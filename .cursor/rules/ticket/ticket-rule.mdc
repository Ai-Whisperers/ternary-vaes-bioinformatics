# Ticket Rule

## What is a Ticket?

A **ticket** is a small, short-lived AI entity that embodies a focused work package. It represents a self-contained unit of work with clear boundaries, objectives, and lifecycle management.

## Key Characteristics

### 1. **Autonomous Knowledge**
- **Knows what needs to be done** - Has a clear plan with objectives, requirements, and implementation steps
- **Knows its history** - Maintains a chronological record of all actions, decisions, and progress
- **Knows its current context** - Understands the technical state, focus areas, and immediate next steps

### 2. **Self-Documenting**
- **Logs everything as it goes** - Every action, decision, and milestone is recorded
- **Maintains traceability** - Clear audit trail from conception to completion
- **Preserves knowledge** - Ensures no context is lost between sessions or handovers

### 3. **Focused Scope**
- **Single responsibility** - Each ticket addresses one specific problem or requirement
- **Clear boundaries** - Well-defined start and end conditions
- **Measurable outcomes** - Success criteria are explicit and verifiable

### 4. **Lifecycle Management**
- **Adaptive complexity** - Can follow simple or complex implementation tracks based on scope
- **Context switching** - Can pause and resume work without losing state
- **Closure discipline** - Has defined completion criteria and wrap-up procedures

## Ticket Components

A ticket consists of structured documentation files that capture different aspects of its knowledge:

- **Plan** - What needs to be done (objectives, requirements, implementation steps)
- **Context** - Current technical state and focus areas
- **Progress** - Chronological log of actions and decisions
- **Timeline** - Timestamped work events and session boundaries
- **Recap** - Summary of outcomes and key learnings
- **RCA** - Root cause analysis for defects/issues
- **References** - Traceability links to related resources

- `@/ticket/context-rule.mdc` - Technical context management
- `@/ticket/progress-rule.mdc` - Progress logging
- `@/ticket/timeline-tracking-rule.mdc` - Timestamped event tracking
- `@/ticket/timeline-workflow-integration.mdc` - Timeline workflow and hours generation
- `@/ticket/recap-rule.mdc` - Outcome summarization
- `@/ticket/rca-rule.mdc` - Root cause analysis
- `@/ticket/references-rule.mdc` - Reference management
- `@/ticket/ticket-workflow-rule.mdc` - Complete workflow processes

## Benefits of the Ticket Model

1. **Cognitive Load Reduction** - Each ticket is a focused AI that doesn't need to understand the entire system
2. **Knowledge Preservation** - All context is explicitly captured and maintained
3. **Parallel Processing** - Multiple tickets can work independently without interference
4. **Quality Assurance** - Structured approach ensures consistent documentation and traceability
5. **Team Collaboration** - Clear handover points and shared understanding of work state

## FINAL MUST-PASS CHECKLIST

- [ ] Ticket concept understood as "small, short-lived AI entity"
- [ ] All 8 components (files) identified correctly
- [ ] Lifecycle includes adaptive complexity assessment
- [ ] Separation of concerns maintained (plan vs context vs progress)
- [ ] Rules referenced by stable ID
- [ ] Benefits clear (traceability, cognitive load reduction)
