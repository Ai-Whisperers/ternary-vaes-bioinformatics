# Epic EPP-192: Standard Configuration Management

## Epic Header
- **Epic ID**: EPP-192
- **Epic Title**: Standard Configuration NL Power for EBASE System Tables
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Priority**: High
- **Created**: 2025-01-15
- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-20

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Tier 1 BRP customers need split EBASE environments for market standard processes and business custom processes. Currently, there is no standardized way to manage core system configuration tables across different environments, leading to:
- Configuration drift between environments
- Inconsistent behavior across installations
- Difficult troubleshooting and support
- Complex environment setup and maintenance

### Business Value
- **Reduced Complexity**: Customers can rely on consistent standard configurations
- **Improved Data Consistency**: All environments start from the same baseline
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between standard and custom configurations
- **Faster Time to Value**: New environments can be bootstrapped quickly
- **Lower Support Costs**: Fewer configuration-related support tickets

### Success Metrics
- All environments have consistent bootstrapped configurations
- Zero configuration drift between standard environments
- 50% reduction in configuration-related support tickets
- New environment setup time reduced from 2 days to 4 hours
- 100% of 11 core tables covered by standard configuration

### Stakeholders
- **Product Owner**: Ralf Klein Breteler
- **Technical Lead**: John Pol
- **Business Stakeholders**: Tier 1 BRP customers
- **Operations Team**: Infrastructure and deployment teams

### Functional Requirements
1. **Extract Configuration Data**
   - Export configuration from any EBASE environment
   - Support multiple output formats (Excel, JSON, CSV)
   - Include metadata and relationships

2. **Compare Configurations**
   - Compare configurations between two environments
   - Identify differences and conflicts
   - Generate diff reports

3. **Update Configurations**
   - Apply standard configuration to target environment
   - Validate before applying changes
   - Support rollback on failure

4. **Manage Templates**
   - Store standard configuration templates
   - Version control for templates
   - Template validation and schema enforcement

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Handle tables with 10,000+ rows efficiently
- **Reliability**: 99.9% success rate for configuration updates
- **Security**: Audit trail for all configuration changes
- **Usability**: Clear error messages and validation feedback

### Acceptance Criteria
- All 11 tables can be extracted and compared
- Configuration differences are clearly identified with field-level detail
- Updates can be applied safely with automatic rollback on failure
- Standard configuration templates are available for new environments
- Full audit trail of all configuration changes

## Technical Overview

### Architecture Impact
- **New Configuration Management Layer**: Sits between EBASE core and database
- **Integration with Existing Systems**: Uses existing EBASE database schema
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for additional tables/formats
- **Independence**: Can run standalone or integrated into EBASE tools

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: C# (.NET 6+)
- **Database**: MSSQL Server with Dapper ORM
- **Export Formats**: Excel (EPPlus), JSON (System.Text.Json), CSV
- **CLI**: Command-line interface for automation
- **API**: REST API for integration

### Integration Points
- **EBASE Database**: Direct database access for configuration tables
- **File System**: For template storage and export files
- **Version Control**: Git for template versioning
- **CI/CD**: Integration with deployment pipelines

### Data Requirements
- **Source Data**: EBASE configuration tables (11 core tables)
- **Template Storage**: File-based templates in Git repository
- **Audit Data**: Change tracking and audit logs
- **Export Files**: Excel/JSON/CSV output files

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

#### 1. Database Schema Changes
- **Risk**: Configuration table schemas may change between versions
- **Impact**: High - Could break extraction/update logic
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Schema versioning and compatibility checks
  - Automated schema validation
  - Support for multiple schema versions

#### 2. Performance Impact
- **Risk**: Large configuration tables may cause performance issues
- **Impact**: Medium - Could slow down extraction/comparison
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Batch processing for large tables
  - Performance optimization and indexing
  - Parallel processing where possible

#### 3. Integration Complexity
- **Risk**: Complex relationships between tables may be difficult to handle
- **Impact**: High - Could result in incomplete or invalid configurations
- **Probability**: Low
- **Mitigation**:
  - Thorough analysis of table relationships
  - Comprehensive testing with production-like data
  - Validation framework for referential integrity

### Business Risks

#### 1. Customer Adoption
- **Risk**: Customers may resist changing their configuration processes
- **Impact**: Medium - Could slow down adoption
- **Probability**: Low
- **Mitigation**:
  - Clear documentation and training materials
  - Gradual rollout with early adopter customers
  - Demonstrate value with pilot implementations

#### 2. Scope Creep
- **Risk**: Requests to add more tables or features
- **Impact**: Medium - Could delay delivery
- **Probability**: High
- **Mitigation**:
  - Clear scope boundaries in documentation
  - Phased approach with well-defined phases
