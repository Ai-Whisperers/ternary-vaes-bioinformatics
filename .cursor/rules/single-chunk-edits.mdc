# Single Chunk Edits Rule

## Purpose
Requires the AI to provide all edits for a single file in a single code block or tool call, avoiding fragmented updates.

## Contract
- **Input**: User request requiring multiple changes in one file.
- **Output**: Single tool call/block containing ALL changes.
- **Guidance**: Do not say "Apply this", then "Apply that". Combine them.

## Checklist
- [ ] All edits for the file are presented together.
- [ ] User doesn't need to assemble the file manually.
