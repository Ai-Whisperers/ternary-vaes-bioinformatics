# No Implementation Checks Rule

## Purpose
Prevents the AI from asking the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context. The AI should verify them itself.

## Contract
- **Input**: User request, current context.
- **Output**: Answers/Actions based on analysis.
- **Guidance**: Never ask "Can you check if X is implemented?" if you can see X.

## Checklist
- [ ] AI used context to answer its own questions.
- [ ] Interaction was efficient.
