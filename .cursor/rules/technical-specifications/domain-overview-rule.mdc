# Domain Overview Documentation Rule

## Purpose & Scope

This rule defines how to create domain overview files that serve as central navigation hubs and comprehensive system architecture documentation for technical specifications.

**Applies to**: Domain overview files at `docs/technical/[domain]/[domain]-domain-overview.md` serving as navigation hubs for all domain documentation including database layer, domain layer, business rules, and integration points.

**Does not apply to**: Individual entity documentation (use domain-object-rule), database schema documentation (use entity-relationship-rule), business rules files (use business-rules-rule), or README files outside technical specifications.

## Inputs (Contract)

- Domain name identified for C++ to C# migration
- Phase 1 data collection findings for this domain
- List of entities, enumerations, business rules, and integration points in domain
- Understanding of domain architecture and entity relationships
- Entity relationship diagram (Mermaid ERD) ready for inclusion

## Outputs (Contract)

Domain overview file containing:
- File at `docs/technical/[domain]/[domain]-domain-overview.md`
- Purpose statement explaining domain's business value and scope
- Entity hierarchy showing main entities and relationships
- Mermaid ERD with business-meaningful labels
- Cross-reference navigation to database layer, domain layer, business rules, integration points
- Stakeholder-specific reading paths (developers, DBAs, architects, business analysts)
- Layered architecture navigation template linking to all domain documentation

## Purpose (Original)

This rule defines how to create domain overview files that serve as central navigation hubs and comprehensive system architecture documentation for technical specifications.

**IMPORTANT**: Domain overview files are the main navigation entry point for each domain's complete layered architecture documentation.

## File Location

Domain overview files are located at the root of each domain:
```text
docs/technical/[domain]/
├── [domain]-domain-overview.md                   # THIS RULE APPLIES HERE (navigation hub)
├── [domain]-business-rules.md                    # Domain logic & algorithms
├── [domain]-integration-points.md                # External system interfaces
├── database/                                     # Database layer (3-file pattern)
│   ├── [domain]-database-schema.md
│   ├── [domain]-database-constraints.md
│   └── [domain]-database-analysis.md
└── domain/                                       # Domain layer (DDD pattern)
    ├── domain-objects/                          # Rich domain models
    └── enumerations/                            # Business enumerations
```

The domain overview provides navigation to all layers and cross-references all documentation within the domain.

## Document Structure

## Deterministic Steps

When creating a domain overview file:

1. **Create File**: Create `[domain]-domain-overview.md` at `docs/technical/[domain]/` root
2. **Add Purpose**: Explain domain's business value, scope, key concepts
3. **Add Entity Hierarchy**: List main entities with brief descriptions
4. **Add Mermaid ERD**: Create entity relationship diagram with business labels
5. **Add Architecture Layers Navigation**: Link to database/, domain/, business rules, integration points
6. **Add Stakeholder Paths**: Provide reading guidance for developers, DBAs, architects, analysts
7. **Add Processing Model**: Describe key business processes and workflows
8. **Validate Links**: Ensure all cross-references point to existing files

## OPSEC and Leak Control

Domain overview files must NOT contain:
- **NO** internal server names, IP addresses, or URLs
- **NO** credentials, tokens, API keys, or passwords
- **NO** employee email addresses or personal information
- **NO** confidential customer data or business-sensitive information
- **NO** proprietary vendor details
- Entity names and business processes only (no infrastructure details)

## Integration Points

This rule works with:
- **rule.technical-specifications.hybrid-architecture.v1**: Defines domain root location for overview files
- **rule.technical-specifications.entity-relationship.v1**: Overview links to database schema files
- **rule.technical-specifications.domain-object.v1**: Overview links to domain object files
- **rule.technical-specifications.business-rules.v1**: Overview links to business rules file
- **rule.technical-specifications.integration-points.v1**: Overview links to integration points file

## Failure Modes and Recovery

**Failure**: Broken links to specification files
- **Detection**: Dead links in navigation sections
- **Recovery**: Update file paths, validate all cross-references

**Failure**: ERD doesn't match actual entity relationships
- **Detection**: Mismatch between diagram and entity specification files
- **Recovery**: Update ERD to match current entity relationships from specifications

**Failure**: Missing navigation to key documentation
- **Detection**: Specification files exist but not linked from overview
- **Recovery**: Add missing cross-references to all specification types

**Failure**: Overview too detailed (duplicating content)
- **Detection**: Extensive field details or business rules in overview
- **Recovery**: Move detailed content to appropriate specification files, keep only navigation and high-level architecture in overview

## Related Rules

- **rule.technical-specifications.hybrid-architecture.v1**: Defines layered folder structure
- **rule.technical-specifications.entity-relationship.v1**: Database schema documentation
- **rule.technical-specifications.domain-object.v1**: Domain entity documentation
