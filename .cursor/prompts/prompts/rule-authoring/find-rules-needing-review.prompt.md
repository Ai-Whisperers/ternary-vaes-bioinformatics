## Purpose

Identify rules requiring review to ensure the rule library maintains high quality and framework compliance. This includes:
- Framework compliance checks
- Quality standards validation
- Integration verification
- Maintenance and update needs
- Technical debt identification
- Improvement opportunities

---

## Required Context

- **Review Focus** (optional): Specific area to focus on
  - `quality`: Front-matter and content standards
  - `integration`: Cross-references and dependencies
  - `maintenance`: Updates, fixes, and technical debt
  - `all`: Comprehensive review (default)

---

## Process

1. **Scan Rule Library**
   - Examine all `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/`
   - Parse front-matter and content structure

2. **Apply Review Criteria**
   - Check front-matter completeness and format
   - Validate content structure and framework compliance
   - Verify cross-references and dependencies
   - Assess maintenance status

3. **Categorize Issues**
   - **Critical**: Breaking framework violations requiring immediate fix
   - **Important**: Quality issues affecting usability
   - **Maintenance**: Updates and improvements needed

4. **Prioritize Findings**
   - Sort by severity and impact
   - Group by domain and type
   - Identify quick wins vs major efforts

5. **Generate Report**
   - Detailed findings with specific issues
   - Actionable recommendations
   - Priority assignments

---

## Reasoning Process (for AI Agent)

When evaluating rules for review:

1. **Framework First**: Critical issues (missing front-matter, invalid YAML) take priority
2. **Impact Assessment**: Consider how issues affect rule effectiveness and library consistency
3. **Effort Estimation**: Balance severity with fix complexity
4. **Standards Compliance**: Ensure alignment with rule-authoring framework requirements
5. **Maintenance Burden**: Identify rules causing ongoing maintenance overhead

---

## Review Criteria

### Quality Issues
- **Front-matter**: Missing required fields, invalid YAML, incorrect format
- **Content**: Missing sections, unclear contracts, poor structure
- **Standards**: Not following rule-file-structure.mdc requirements
- **Documentation**: Missing references, outdated information

### Integration Issues
- **Cross-references**: Broken `requires` or `implements` fields
- **Dependencies**: Referenced rules that don't exist
- **Domains**: Rules in wrong domain folders
- **Naming**: IDs not following naming conventions

### Maintenance Issues
- **Age**: Long time since last review (stale provenance)
- **Versions**: Outdated major versions or missing patches
- **Consistency**: Not aligned with current framework standards
- **Completeness**: Missing required sections or contracts

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: No rules found needing review
**Cause**: Very high quality standards or recent cleanup
**Solution**: Lower threshold or check if review criteria are too strict

**Issue**: Too many rules flagged
**Cause**: Review criteria too broad or standards too high
**Solution**: Focus on specific domains or adjust criteria

**Issue**: Inconsistent results
**Cause**: Review criteria not applied uniformly
**Solution**: Document specific standards and ensure consistent application
