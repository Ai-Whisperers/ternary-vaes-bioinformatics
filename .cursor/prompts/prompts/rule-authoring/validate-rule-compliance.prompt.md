# Validate Rule Compliance

Please validate the following rule file against the rule authoring framework:

**Rule File Path**: `eneve.domain/.cursor/rules/podcast/` (entire folder)

## Validation Checklist

1. **File Structure**:
   - Front-matter present and well-formed?
   - Required YAML fields present (rule_id, title, version)?
   - Sections in correct order?
   - Markdown formatting correct?

2. **Front Matter Validation**:
   ```yaml
   Required fields:
   - rule_id: [category]-[name]-rule format?
   - title: Clear and descriptive?
   - version: Semantic versioning (X.Y.Z)?
   - created: Valid date (YYYY-MM-DD)?
   - status: active/draft/deprecated?

   Optional but recommended:
   - tags: Relevant keywords?
   - governs: File patterns (if file-mask rule)?
   - applies_to: File types?
   ```

3. **Rule ID Validation**:
   - Follows naming convention?
   - Pattern: `[category]-[descriptive-name]-rule`
   - Lowercase with hyphens?
   - Ends with `-rule`?

4. **Invocation Strategy**:
   - Clear strategy defined (file-mask/agentic/always)?
   - If file-mask: `governs` field present with glob patterns?
   - If agentic: Description clearly states when to use?
   - If always-apply: Documented in always-applied rules?

5. **Content Structure**:
   - Purpose section clearly states what rule does?
   - Scope section defines boundaries?
   - When to Apply section provides clear conditions?
   - Rule Definition section has concrete rules?

6. **Contracts and Scope**:
   - Input expectations documented?
   - Output specifications documented?
   - Preconditions stated?
   - Postconditions stated?
   - Boundaries clear (what's in/out of scope)?

7. **Quality Checklist**:
   - Validation checklist present?
   - Checklist items specific and verifiable?
   - Checklist comprehensive?
   - Items have clear pass/fail criteria?

8. **Examples**:
   - Good examples provided?
   - Bad examples (anti-patterns) provided?
   - Examples are realistic and relevant?
   - Examples clearly show compliance vs violation?

9. **Cross-References**:
   - References to related rules?
   - Links to templars (if applicable)?
   - Links to exemplars (if applicable)?
   - Links are valid and working?

10. **Templar/Exemplar Alignment**:
    - If rule references templars, do they exist?
    - If rule references exemplars, do they exist?
    - Are references using stable IDs?
