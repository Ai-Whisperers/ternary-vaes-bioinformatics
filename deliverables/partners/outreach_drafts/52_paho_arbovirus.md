**Subject:** DENV-4 detection gap in surveillance - primer design challenge

---

Dear PAHO Arbovirus Team,

Researchers in Paraguay here. We've identified a potential gap in pan-dengue surveillance: DENV-4 is significantly more diverse than other serotypes (71.7% vs 95%+ identity), which may affect diagnostic sensitivity.

Standard degenerate primers that work for DENV-1/2/3 may miss DENV-4 variants. 97.4% of the DENV-4 genome lacks conserved windows suitable for universal primers.

We've designed primers specifically targeting DENV-4's few conserved regions, plus pan-arbovirus primers for ZIKV, CHIKV, and MAYV.

Question: Is this diversity issue known in PAHO surveillance guidelines? If member states are experiencing lower DENV-4 detection rates, this might explain it.

Happy to share our primer sequences for evaluation by reference laboratories.

Best,
