**Subject:** DENV-4 as ancient lineage? Diversity data suggests different history

---

Prof. Holmes,

Your work on deep RNA virus evolution got me thinking about dengue serotype relationships. We've quantified something that suggests DENV-4 may have a different evolutionary history.

The data: DENV-4 sequences have 71.7% average identity vs. 95-98% for DENV-1/2/3. This isn't just a few divergent strains - 97.4% of the DENV-4 genome lacks conserved primer windows.

Two hypotheses: (1) DENV-4 represents an older lineage that's had more time to diversify, or (2) different selection pressures/population dynamics.

From your perspective on RNA virus deep evolution - does this level of within-serotype divergence suggest ancient origins, or could other factors explain it? I'm not sure how to interpret the magnitude.

Best,
