Prof. Kortemme,

Your benchmarking work on Rosetta stability predictions sets the standard for evaluation rigor. I'm trying to figure out if an approach we're testing is worth pursuing further.

We embed codon sequences (not amino acids) in hyperbolic space and predict DDG without structure. On S669, we get ρ=0.585 sequence-only, but our failures look different from Rosetta's - we fail on buried hydrophobic core, Rosetta fails on surface charge clusters.

Question: In your benchmarking experience, is "orthogonal failure modes" a good sign that methods capture different information, or is it usually just noise at small sample sizes?

Trying to decide if this is worth investing more time in.

Best,
