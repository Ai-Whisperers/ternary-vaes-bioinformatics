**Subject:** DENV-4 surveillance question - your historical perspective?

---

Prof. Gubler,

Your decades of dengue work have shaped everything we know about the disease. I'm reaching out with a finding that might connect to observations from your surveillance experience.

We've found DENV-4 has significantly more genomic diversity than other serotypes (71.7% identity vs 95-98%). This creates primer design challenges - 97.4% of the genome has no conserved windows suitable for universal primers.

Historical question: in your surveillance experience, have you observed lower DENV-4 detection rates or more variable assay performance for this serotype? If so, this diversity might explain it.

I'm curious whether this is a "known" issue among experienced dengue researchers that hasn't been formally documented, or genuinely new.

Would value your perspective.

Best,
