**Subject:** Hyperbolic embeddings for viral evolution visualization?

---

Trevor,

Nextstrain's visualization of viral phylogenies is incredibly useful. I've been thinking about whether hyperbolic geometry could complement the tree-based views.

We're using Poincaré ball embeddings for sequence analysis, and they naturally represent hierarchical relationships (like phylogenies) with less distortion than Euclidean 2D projections. The radial dimension encodes "evolutionary depth."

Have you considered hyperbolic visualizations for Nextstrain? The math might map nicely to phylogenetic trees, though I don't know if the added complexity is worth it for the typical user.

Curious for your thoughts as someone who's thought deeply about viral evolution visualization.

Best,
