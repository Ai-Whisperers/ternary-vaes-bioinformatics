**Subject:** Unusual DENV-4 diversity we found - consistent with WRCEVA data?

---

Dr. Weaver,

While designing pan-dengue primers, we found something unexpected: DENV-4 sequences in GenBank show only 71.7% pairwise identity vs. 95-98% for DENV-1/2/3. This means 97% of the DENV-4 genome has no conserved 20bp window for standard primer design.

This "cryptic diversity" could explain surveillance gaps - standard degenerate primers may miss many DENV-4 variants.

Question: Does this match what WRCEVA sees in clinical isolates? We're wondering if it's real biology or GenBank sampling bias.

Happy to share the analysis if useful for your surveillance protocols.

Best,
