**Subject:** Question about lenacapavir resistance monitoring

---

Dear Gilead Medical Affairs,

Lenacapavir's novel mechanism (capsid inhibition) means resistance monitoring differs from traditional ART. We've built HIV resistance screening tools integrated with Stanford HIVdb and have a question.

For lenacapavir-specific resistance: are there established screening criteria for capsid mutations that should preclude treatment? Our current tools focus on NNRTI/INSTI (for CAB/RPV eligibility) but could extend to capsid if criteria exist.

If Gilead has published guidance on resistance monitoring for lenacapavir patients, we'd appreciate the reference. We want our tools to stay current with treatment advances.

Best,
