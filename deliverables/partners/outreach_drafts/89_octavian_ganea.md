## EMAIL

**To:** oct@mit.edu (or NYU email if available)

**Subject:** P-adic structure for hyperbolic embeddings - principled hierarchy?

---

Octavian,

Your work on extending neural networks to hyperbolic space provides the theoretical foundation for our application. We've added something: p-adic valuation as the source of hierarchy.

The combination: p-adic valuation on ternary operations (3^9 codon space) creates a natural tree. Poincare ball embeds this tree efficiently. Results: rho=-0.83 hierarchy correlation, 82.8% ultrametric compliance, rho=0.58 stability prediction.

Question: is using p-adic valuation as the hierarchy source theoretically sound, or are we getting lucky? The ultrametric property of p-adic distance seems to match hyperbolic geometry naturally, but I haven't seen this combination discussed.

Would your perspective on the theory be valuable?

Best,
