**Subject:** HIV-CAUSAL methodology question - TDR as baseline confounder?

Prof. Hernán,

Your HIV-CAUSAL work on target trial emulation has influenced how we think about observational HIV data. We've built a TDR screening tool and have a methodological question.

In your cohort studies, is transmitted drug resistance typically handled as a baseline confounder? We're finding that pre-treatment resistance patterns may affect treatment effect estimates, but I'm unsure how causal inference frameworks typically address this.

Our tool detects TDR using Stanford HIVdb plus p-adic features (geometric embedding of codons). If resistance confounding matters, batch screening cohorts before analysis might improve effect estimates.

Has this been addressed in HIV-CAUSAL publications? Any methodological pointers would be helpful.

Best,
