**Subject:** DMS validation question - do geometric features predict fitness?

---

Jesse,

Your DMS work provides ground truth for viral fitness. We've been testing whether geometric embeddings of sequences correlate with your experimental measurements.

The idea: we embed proteins in hyperbolic space where radial position reflects evolutionary constraint. If constrained positions are functionally important, our geometric "fitness" should correlate with your measured fitness.

Quick question: do you have DMS data available for benchmarking? We'd want to test correlation between our embedding-derived constraint scores and your experimental fitness values. If r > 0.3 or so, the geometric approach captures real signal. If lower, it's just recapitulating sequence conservation.

We're getting decent protein stability predictions (Spearman 0.58) but haven't tested against DMS directly.

Best,
