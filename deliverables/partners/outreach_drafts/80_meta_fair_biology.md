**Subject:** ESM + hyperbolic geometry - complementary hierarchical signal?

---

Alexander,

ESM models transformed protein representation learning. We've been exploring whether hyperbolic geometry captures complementary information that Euclidean embeddings miss.

Our approach: embed codon sequences (not amino acids) in Poincare space using p-adic structure. This naturally encodes the hierarchical tree structure of sequence relationships that flat geometry distorts exponentially.

Results: rho=-0.83 hierarchy correlation, rho=0.58 stability prediction, 82.8% ultrametric compliance.

Question: have you observed that ESM embeddings struggle with certain hierarchical relationships? Our hyperbolic features might fill that gap, or ESM's attention patterns might already capture this implicitly.

Would understanding where ESM embeddings fail help identify what p-adic features add?

Best,
