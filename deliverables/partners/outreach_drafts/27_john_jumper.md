**Subject:** Stability signal for low-pLDDT regions

AlphaFold Team,

For regions where AlphaFold has low pLDDT (uncertain structure), would sequence-based stability signals be useful?

We've built a predictor using codon embeddings in hyperbolic space (ρ=0.58 on S669 subset (N=52)). It doesn't need structure - just sequence. Might complement AlphaFold where structural confidence is low.

Is this something you've considered, or is pLDDT already correlated with the stability signal?

Best,
