Prof. Hancock,

Your work on host defense peptides and immunomodulatory mechanisms is foundational for the AMP field. I'm wondering if a computational tool we've built might be useful for your screening efforts.

We've developed an MIC predictor (ρ=0.66 vs. E. coli) using an unusual approach - embedding peptides in hyperbolic space. It captures something different from standard physicochemical features.

Two potential uses:
1. Pre-screening designed peptides before synthesis
2. Prioritizing natural peptide candidates for testing

Would this be useful for your lab's workflow? Happy to run predictions on any peptide set you're considering.

Best,
