**Subject:** Your HIV deep learning work - curious about feature representations

Maggie,

Found your HIV resistance prediction work on GitHub. We've taken a different approach using p-adic geometry instead of learned embeddings, and I'm curious whether the features capture different signals.

Our sequence-only method embeds codons in hyperbolic space, capturing evolutionary constraints that standard MLPs might miss. Stanford HIVdb integration handles clinical interpretation.

Question: in your architecture, do you see cases where standard ML features fail but evolutionary structure would help? Trying to understand where geometric features add value vs. being redundant.

Would comparing failure modes on the same test set be useful?

Best,
