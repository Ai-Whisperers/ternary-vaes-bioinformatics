Dr. Vignuzzi,

Your work on viral fitness landscapes and mutational tolerance addresses constraints that shape viral evolution. We've been exploring whether geometric methods capture similar information differently.

Our approach: embed viral sequences in hyperbolic space where radial position correlates with evolutionary constraint (highly constrained = closer to center). For arboviruses, we can identify conserved regions that likely reflect fitness valleys.

The DENV-4 finding: 71.7% sequence identity vs 95%+ for other serotypes, suggesting either relaxed constraint or more ancient divergence. The hyperbolic embedding shows this as greater radial spread.

Question: would a geometric "constraint score" be useful for predicting which mutations are fitness-costly? Or does this just recapitulate what conservation scores already capture?

Best,
