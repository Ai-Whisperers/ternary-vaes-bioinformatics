**Subject:** Continuous embeddings from BEAST trees - potential use case?

---

Prof. Rambaut,

BEAST produces discrete tree structures with posterior uncertainty. We've been experimenting with converting phylogenetic trees to continuous hyperbolic embeddings - wondering if there's a use case.

The conversion preserves hierarchical distances but gives you a continuous manifold instead of discrete topology. Potential advantages: interpolation between sequences, distance queries without tree traversal, easier integration with ML methods.

For arbovirus work, we found DENV-4 embeds differently than other serotypes - greater spread reflecting its unusual diversity (71.7% identity vs 95%+).

Is there demand for continuous phylogenetic representations, or do trees work well enough for most applications? Curious about your perspective as someone who's thought deeply about phylogenetic inference.

Best,
