**Subject:** Target stability assessment - fast sequence-only screening relevant?

---

Insilico Team,

Your AI drug discovery pipeline has impressive clinical results. Quick question about target analysis.

We've built a sequence-only stability predictor using hyperbolic geometry (rho=0.58 on S669). It screens thousands of variants per second without requiring structure. The evolutionary constraints it captures sometimes flag instabilities that physics-based methods miss.

Practical question: in your target identification workflow, is fast sequence-level stability screening useful before expensive experimental validation? Or do your structural methods already handle target druggability assessment well?

If there's value in orthogonal stability signal for variant analysis, happy to discuss.

Best,
