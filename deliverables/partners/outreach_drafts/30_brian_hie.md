**Subject:** Hyperbolic embeddings for evolutionary prediction?

Brian,

Your viral escape prediction work captures evolutionary information through protein language models. I'm wondering if explicit hyperbolic geometry would help.

We embed sequences in Poincaré space using p-adic structure. The geometry enforces ultrametric-like distances (82.8% compliance) - which should match phylogenetic relationships.

Results: stability prediction ρ=0.58 (N=52). Haven't tried viral escape yet.

Question: Do you think hyperbolic inductive bias would help for evolutionary prediction, or does the PLM attention already capture hierarchical relationships implicitly?

Best,
