**Subject:** Open-source TDR screening tool - potential for surveillance programs

---

Dear UNAIDS,

WHO recommends transmitted drug resistance surveillance in countries scaling up ART. We've built an open-source TDR screening tool integrating Stanford HIVdb that might support these programs.

The tool screens HIV sequences for resistance mutations relevant to first-line regimens and long-acting injectables. It's free for public health use.

Question: would this be useful for UNAIDS partner programs implementing TDR surveillance? If so, what validation would be needed before deployment?

We're based in Paraguay (CONACYT-funded) and interested in supporting Latin American surveillance efforts specifically.
