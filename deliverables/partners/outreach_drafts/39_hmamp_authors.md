Hi,

Your HMAMP paper on hypervolume-based multi-objective AMP optimization is directly relevant to our work. We've implemented NSGA-II with p-adic hyperbolic embeddings for the same problem.

The key difference: HMAMP uses hypervolume indicators while we use Pareto ranking. Both optimize for activity, toxicity, and synthesis - curious whether the optimization algorithm or the feature representation matters more.

Would you be interested in a methods comparison? We could run both approaches on identical objective functions and compare:
- Pareto front coverage
- Best single-objective solutions
- Computational cost

If HMAMP consistently outperforms, we'd switch. If results are similar, maybe the representation matters more than the algorithm.

Best,
