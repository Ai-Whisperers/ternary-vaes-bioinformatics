**Subject:** v-PuNNs paper - biological validation of ultrametric learning?

---

Dr. N'guessan,

Your v-PuNNs paper on ultrametric representation learning is exactly the theoretical framework we've been applying empirically. We may have biological validation data for your approach.

Our application: embedding codon sequences using 3-adic valuation in Poincare space. Different architecture (VAE vs. van der Put basis) but same mathematical principle - ultrametric structure should match the data.

Results: 82.8% ultrametric compliance in biological data, rho=-0.83 hierarchy correlation, and downstream validation (stability prediction rho=0.58).

Question: does our biological application provide the kind of empirical support that v-PuNNs theory predicts? The ultrametric compliance is high but not perfect - is ~83% typical for real data?

Would connecting on ultrametric ML be valuable?

Best,
