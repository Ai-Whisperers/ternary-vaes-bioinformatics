Anne-Marie,

Your work on how commensals and pathogens respond differently to host defenses got me thinking about AMP selectivity.

We're trying to computationally design peptides that kill pathogens but spare beneficial bacteria. Our optimizer can target WHO priority pathogens, but I'm not confident the selectivity predictions are meaningful - the training data doesn't distinguish commensal vs. pathogen responses.

From your mechanistic perspective: is pathogen-selective AMP design fundamentally feasible, or are the membrane composition differences too subtle? If there are specific features (LPS modifications, surface charge patterns) that confer selective vulnerability, we could try to optimize for those.

Would value your take on whether this is worth pursuing.

Best,
