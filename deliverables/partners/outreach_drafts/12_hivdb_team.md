## EMAIL

**To:** hivdbteam@stanford.edu

**Subject:** Sierra API usage guidelines for open-source TDR tool?

---

HIVdb Team,

We've built an open-source tool that wraps the Sierra API for batch TDR screening and LA-injectable eligibility assessment. It's intended for academic/clinical use in resource-limited settings (we're CONACYT-funded in Paraguay).

Before sharing it more broadly, wanted to check:

1. Are there API rate limits or usage guidelines we should document?
2. Should we include specific attribution language beyond linking to HIVdb?
3. Any concerns about our interpretation logic that you'd want to review?

Happy to share the codebase for your review. We want to make sure we're representing HIVdb appropriately.
