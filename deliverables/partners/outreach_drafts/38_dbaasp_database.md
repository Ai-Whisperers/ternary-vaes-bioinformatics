## EMAIL

**To:** dbaasp@dbaasp.org

**Subject:** DBAASP data quality - our predictions flag potential outliers

---

Dear DBAASP Team,

DBAASP's quantitative MIC annotations with experimental conditions are uniquely valuable. We trained a predictor on AMP activity data and noticed some entries where our predictions strongly disagree with recorded values.

Rather than assuming our model is wrong, we wondered if some might be data entry errors or experimental outliers. We could provide a list of ~50 entries with large prediction residuals for your review.

This isn't criticism - outlier detection is a natural use for ML predictions. If any turn out to be actual errors, fixing them helps everyone. If they're correct, the discordant cases tell us what our model misses.

Would this be useful?

Best,
