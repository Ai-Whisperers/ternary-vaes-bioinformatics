**Subject:** MIC prediction using non-standard features - your thoughts?

Cesar,

Your Nature Reviews piece on ML for AMP design covers the standard feature engineering approaches well. We've been experimenting with something different - embedding peptide sequences in hyperbolic space using p-adic number theory.

Early results: Spearman ρ=0.39 for MIC prediction against E. coli (p<0.001, N=105), using features that don't correlate with typical physicochemical descriptors. Performance varies by pathogen - still working on Gram-positives. Wondering if this captures something the standard pipelines miss or if we're overfitting to quirks in the training data.

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick sanity check? Happy to share predictions on any peptide set you're working with.

Best,
