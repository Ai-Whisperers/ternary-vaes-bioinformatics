**Subject:** MIC prediction using non-standard features - your thoughts?

Cesar,

Your Nature Reviews piece on ML for AMP design covers the standard feature engineering approaches well. We've been experimenting with something different - embedding peptide sequences in hyperbolic space using p-adic number theory.

Early results: Spearman ρ=0.656 for MIC prediction against E. coli using features that don't correlate with typical physicochemical descriptors. Wondering if this captures something the standard pipelines miss or if we're overfitting to quirks in the training data.

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick sanity check? Happy to share predictions on any peptide set you're working with.

Best,
