(Use first name once identified),

Your p-ClustVal paper on p-adic clustering for single-cell data caught my attention - we're applying similar mathematics to a different problem!

Our domain: codon sequences rather than scRNA-seq. We embed 19,683 ternary operations in Poincare space using 3-adic valuation. Results: rho=-0.83 hierarchy correlation, 82.8% ultrametric compliance, rho=0.58 stability prediction downstream.

Question: have you observed that p-adic clustering captures structure that standard methods miss? We're finding the ultrametric property seems to matter for biological hierarchy - curious if you see similar patterns in single-cell data.

Exciting to see p-adic biology emerging as a field! Would connecting be useful?
