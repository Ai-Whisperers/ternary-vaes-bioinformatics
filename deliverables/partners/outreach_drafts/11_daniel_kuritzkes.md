Dr. Kuritzkes,

Given your expertise in HIV drug resistance and long-acting antiretrovirals, I wanted to ask about a clinical decision support tool we've built.

It screens patient sequences for CAB-LA and RPV-LA eligibility using the Stanford HIVdb API - essentially automating the resistance check that clinicians should do before prescribing Cabenuva.

Two questions:
1. Is there clinical demand for this in settings where LA-injectables are expanding?
2. What resistance criteria would you prioritize for the eligibility check?

We're using it in Paraguay (CONACYT-funded) and trying to understand if it's useful more broadly.

Best,
