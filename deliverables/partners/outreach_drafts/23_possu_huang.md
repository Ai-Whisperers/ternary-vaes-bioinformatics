**Subject:** Pre-screening designed sequences for stability?

Possu,

Your de novo design work generates novel sequences that don't have evolutionary history. I'm curious whether stability prediction tools are useful in your pipeline.

We've built a predictor using codon embeddings (ρ=0.58 on natural proteins), but I'm not sure if it would generalize to designed sequences. The features capture evolutionary constraints, which designed proteins might not have.

Do you currently use any computational stability screening before synthesis? If so, what works/doesn't work for novel designs?

Trying to understand if there's a gap our approach might fill, or if the designed protein space is fundamentally different.

Best,
