**Subject:** GDL perspective on p-adic hyperbolic biology - principled inductive bias?

---

Prof. Bronstein,

Your geometric deep learning framework provides exactly the lens we need to evaluate our approach. We've combined hyperbolic geometry with p-adic algebra for biological sequences.

From a GDL perspective: p-adic valuation on ternary operations (3^9 codon space) creates a natural tree structure. Poincare ball is the correct geometry for trees. This gives us principled inductive bias for hierarchical biological relationships.

Results: rho=-0.83 hierarchy correlation, 82.8% ultrametric compliance, rho=0.58 stability prediction downstream.

Question: does this count as "matching the geometry to the domain" in GDL terms? Or is the p-adic-to-hyperbolic mapping too indirect to qualify as principled inductive bias?

Would your perspective on whether this is sound GDL be valuable.

Best,
