**Subject:** DENV-4 primers for mosquito surveillance - design challenge

---

Nathan,

Your mosquito-based arbovirus surveillance work faces a challenge we've been working on: DENV-4 has much lower sequence conservation than other serotypes (71.7% vs 95%+).

For mosquito pools where you need to catch all circulating variants, standard degenerate primers may systematically miss divergent DENV-4. We found 97.4% of the DENV-4 genome has no 20bp windows conserved across known variants.

We've designed primers targeting the few truly conserved DENV-4 regions. The tradeoff: they're more specific (less degenerate) but should amplify more variants.

Curious whether you've seen differential amplification across serotypes in mosquito samples. If DENV-4 drops out more often, this diversity might explain it.

Happy to share primer sequences if useful.

Best,
