**Subject:** Feature orthogonality in stability prediction?

Prof. Kim,

Your mCSM tools are widely used for stability prediction. I'm trying to understand if a different feature set we're using captures orthogonal information.

We embed codon sequences (not amino acids) in hyperbolic space. On S669, we get ρ=0.585 sequence-only. The interesting part: our failure cases look different from structure-based methods.

Would you expect codon-level features to correlate with your mCSM features, or capture something distinct? Trying to assess whether combining approaches could improve coverage.

Best,
