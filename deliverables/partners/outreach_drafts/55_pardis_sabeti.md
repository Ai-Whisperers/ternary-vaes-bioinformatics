**Subject:** Hyperbolic geometry for viral forecasting - relevant to outbreak response?

---

Prof. Sabeti,

Your outbreak genomics work raised a question for us: can geometric methods help predict viral evolution during epidemics?

We've built hyperbolic embeddings of viral sequences where radial position correlates with evolutionary constraint. The idea is that hyperbolic space naturally represents phylogenetic trees (exponential leaf growth matches hyperbolic volume).

Applied to dengue, we found DENV-4 embeds differently - greater spread reflecting its unusual diversity (71.7% identity vs 95%+ for other serotypes). This led to better primer design for the divergent serotype.

My question: for outbreak response, would continuous geometric representations offer anything over discrete phylogenies? The potential advantage is real-time interpolation - predicting where sequences might evolve before you sequence them.

Or is this overcomplicating what trees already do well?

Best,
