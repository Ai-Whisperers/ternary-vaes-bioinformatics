**Subject:** DENV-4 diversity in Thai strains - observed in your cohorts?

---

Dr. Sakuntabhai,

Your long-term Thai dengue cohorts provide unique data on all four serotypes. We've found something in genomic analysis that might connect to your surveillance observations.

DENV-4 has significantly more diversity than other serotypes globally (71.7% vs 95%+ identity). This means primers designed from consensus sequences may miss divergent DENV-4 variants.

Question from your cohort experience: have you observed differential detection rates across serotypes? Specifically, does DENV-4 sometimes show lower positivity rates or require different assay conditions?

If Thai DENV-4 strains have similar diversity, standard pan-dengue primers might systematically underdetect this serotype.

We've designed primers specifically targeting DENV-4's conserved regions. Happy to share for testing against your Thai variants if relevant.

Best,
