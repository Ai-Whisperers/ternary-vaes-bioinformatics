**Subject:** TDR tools for resource-limited settings - practical deployment?

Ravi,

Your global HIV resistance work addresses settings where sequencing capacity is limited. We've built TDR screening tools and are thinking about deployment in such contexts.

Question: what's the practical bottleneck for resistance screening in resource-limited settings? Is it sequencing access, interpretation expertise, or something else? Our tools integrate Stanford HIVdb for interpretation, but that only helps if sequences are available.

If the issue is sequencing cost/access, computational tools may be less relevant than we thought. If interpretation is the bottleneck, we might be useful.

Would appreciate your perspective on where computational tools actually fit in global HIV care.

Best,
