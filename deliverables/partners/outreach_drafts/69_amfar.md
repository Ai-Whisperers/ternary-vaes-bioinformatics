**Subject:** Novel geometric approach to HIV sequence analysis

Dear amfAR,

Your support for innovative HIV research has been transformative. We've developed a novel computational approach using p-adic (ultrametric) geometry for HIV sequence analysis.

The core idea: embed viral sequences in hyperbolic space where geometric position encodes evolutionary constraints. This captures information standard methods miss - like which positions can tolerate mutations and which are structurally locked.

For HIV, this might help understand:
- Why certain reservoir sequences persist
- Which mutations compromise viral fitness
- Evolutionary constraints on cure-relevant targets

Current validated applications: resistance screening, stability prediction (Spearman 0.58).

Would this approach be relevant for amfAR-funded cure research? Happy to discuss how it might complement ongoing work.

Best,
