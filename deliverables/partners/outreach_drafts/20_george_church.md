**Subject:** Codon-level fitness prediction for library design

Prof. Church,

Your multiplex genome engineering work generates massive variant libraries. We've built a codon-level fitness predictor that might help prioritize variants.

It embeds codons in hyperbolic space and predicts stability (ρ=0.58 on S669) without structure. Fast enough to score millions of sequences.

Would this be useful for filtering large designed libraries before synthesis? Trying to understand if there's demand for pre-synthesis computational screening at the codon (not just amino acid) level.

Happy to run predictions on any design set if useful.

Best,
