**Subject:** Hyperbolic geometry for hierarchical biology data?

---

Prof. Pe'er,

PHATE preserves continuous structure in single-cell data beautifully. I'm curious whether hyperbolic geometry would help for explicitly hierarchical data (like cell lineages or protein families).

We've been using Poincaré ball embeddings for codon sequences. The radial dimension encodes hierarchy naturally - no need to discover it, it's built into the geometry.

Results on proteins: stability prediction ρ=0.58, ultrametric compliance 82.8%.

Have you considered hyperbolic variants of your manifold learning methods? The math is messier, but the inductive bias for tree-like structure is stronger.

Best,
