**Subject:** Sequence diversity analysis - potentially useful for immunogen design?

---

Dr. Feinberg,

IAVI's work on HIV vaccine immunogen design requires understanding viral diversity. We've developed a sequence analysis approach that might offer a different perspective.

Our method embeds viral sequences in hyperbolic space using p-adic geometry. This captures hierarchical evolutionary relationships differently than standard distance metrics. For vaccine design, it might help identify conserved regions under geometric constraints (not just low Shannon entropy).

Quick question: does IAVI's computational pipeline already capture ultrametric relationships in viral phylogenies, or would a different geometric lens on diversity be useful?

Not proposing a collaboration—just asking if this type of analysis is already covered or might fill a gap.

Best,
