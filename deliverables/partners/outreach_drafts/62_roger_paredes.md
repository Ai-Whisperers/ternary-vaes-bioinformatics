**Subject:** Deep sequencing vs. standard genotyping for TDR - sensitivity comparison?

Dr. Paredes,

Your deep sequencing work for minority variant detection is directly relevant to TDR screening. We've built standard genotyping-based tools using Stanford HIVdb and have a question about sensitivity.

For treatment-naive patients: does deep sequencing detect clinically relevant TDR that standard approaches miss? If minority variants at <20% frequency matter for treatment outcomes, our standard-depth tools would underdetect.

Curious about your experience. If deep sequencing consistently finds additional TDR, we should probably shift our approach (or at least flag cases where deeper analysis is warranted).

Any pointers to published comparisons would be helpful.

Best,
