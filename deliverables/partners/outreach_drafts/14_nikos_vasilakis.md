**Subject:** DENV-4 evolutionary divergence - ancient lineage?

---

Dr. Vasilakis,

Your work on arbovirus emergence and evolutionary dynamics made me want to ask about something we found.

DENV-4 sequences show only 71.7% pairwise identity compared to 95%+ for DENV-1/2/3. This extreme diversity means 97% of the genome lacks conserved 20bp windows for primer design.

My naive interpretation: DENV-4 either diverged much earlier than the other serotypes, or has experienced different selection pressures. Does this match the evolutionary history you've studied, or is there another explanation I'm missing?

Trying to understand whether this is sampling bias or real biology.

Best,
