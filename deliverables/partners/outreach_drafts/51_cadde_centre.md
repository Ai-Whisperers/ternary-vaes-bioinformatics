Dear CADDE Team,

As researchers in Paraguay (CONACYT-funded), we've been following your arbovirus genomics work in Brazil. We've developed computational tools for primer design that might complement your field surveillance.

The specific challenge we've addressed: DENV-4 has much lower sequence conservation (71.7% identity) than other serotypes (95%+). This means standard primer approaches often miss DENV-4 variants - potentially relevant for Brazilian surveillance where all serotypes circulate.

Our tools identify the few truly conserved regions across all seven major arboviruses (DENV-1/2/3/4, ZIKV, CHIKV, MAYV).

Would there be interest in testing our primer designs against Brazilian strains? We could provide sequences optimized for your circulating variants if you share representative genome accessions.

Best,
