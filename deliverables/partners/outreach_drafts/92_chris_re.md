## EMAIL

**To:** chrismre@cs.stanford.edu

**Subject:** Yet another inductive bias for sequences - p-adic geometry vs. state spaces?

---

Chris,

Mamba and S4 provide elegant mathematical alternatives to attention. We've stumbled onto a third option: p-adic geometry for biological sequences.

Different mathematical foundations:
- SSMs: linear systems theory, memory/decay
- Ours: number theory, ultrametric hierarchy

Our approach embeds codons in Poincare space using 3-adic valuation. No recurrence, no attention - the geometry alone captures structure (rho=-0.83 hierarchy, rho=0.58 stability prediction).

Question: do you think there's a unifying principle behind why different mathematical structures (recurrence, attention, geometry) all enable sequence modeling? Or are these fundamentally different capabilities for different tasks?

Curious about your architectural philosophy perspective.

Best,
