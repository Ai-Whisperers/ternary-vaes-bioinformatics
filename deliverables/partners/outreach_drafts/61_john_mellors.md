**Subject:** TDR screening question - pre-treatment resistance detection rates?

---

Prof. Mellors,

Your longitudinal HIV cohort work provides unique insights into resistance emergence. We've built a TDR screening tool integrating Stanford HIVdb and have a practical question.

Our tool screens for transmitted drug resistance before treatment initiation. For validation, we'd want to compare against cohort data showing actual TDR prevalence and clinical outcomes.

Question: in your cohorts, what's the typical TDR detection rate, and does pre-treatment screening change outcomes? Specifically interested in whether computational screening (vs. full genotyping) provides sufficient sensitivity for clinical decision-making.

If you've published data comparing screening approaches, I'd appreciate the reference.

Best,
