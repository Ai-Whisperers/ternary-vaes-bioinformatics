**Subject:** Biology tutorial contribution - Poincare embeddings for codon sequences?

---

Geomstats Maintainers,

Thanks for the library - it's enabled important research. We've built a biological application of Poincare embeddings that might make a useful tutorial/example.

Our use case: embedding codon sequences in Poincare ball using p-adic valuation structure. Results: rho=-0.83 hierarchy correlation, 82.8% ultrametric compliance, downstream stability prediction rho=0.58.

We'd like to contribute back:
- Tutorial notebook showing biological Poincare application
- Example of combining algebraic structure (p-adic) with geometric ML
- Real dataset with validated downstream tasks

Question: would this kind of biological example be useful for geomstats documentation? Happy to adapt format to your contribution guidelines.

Best,
