Prof. Castanho,

Your biophysical characterization work on AMPs - particularly the membrane binding studies - addresses exactly what computational methods struggle to predict accurately.

We've developed a multi-objective peptide optimizer that generates candidates balancing activity (MIC), toxicity, and synthesis feasibility. The computational predictions look reasonable (0.66 Spearman for MIC), but we lack biophysical validation.

Would you have interest in characterizing a small set (5-10) of our top-ranked candidates? We could provide sequences optimized for specific activity/selectivity tradeoffs, and your measurements would help validate (or invalidate) our approach.

Best,
