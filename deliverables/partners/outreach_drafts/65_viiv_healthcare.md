**To:** (Medical Affairs or Research Partnerships)

**Subject:** LA injectable eligibility screening - decision support tool

---

Dear ViiV Medical Affairs,

Cabenuva's success is expanding long-acting HIV treatment access. Healthcare providers need tools to identify eligible patients - we've built one.

Our LA eligibility screener integrates Stanford HIVdb to flag:
- CAB-relevant resistance mutations
- RPV-relevant resistance mutations  
- Patients who may need additional evaluation before LA initiation

It's designed for clinic workflows where providers need quick eligibility checks before discussing LA options with patients.

Question: would ViiV have interest in HCP tools that support appropriate patient selection? We're academic (non-commercial license) but could discuss how this fits with ViiV's HCP education efforts.

Best,
