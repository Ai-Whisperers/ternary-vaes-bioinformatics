**Subject:** Orthogonal signal to ML-ddG? Quick question

Prof. Lindorff-Larsen,

Your ML-ddG benchmark work sets a high bar for stability prediction evaluation. I'm trying to understand whether a different approach we're testing captures genuinely orthogonal information or just correlates with existing features.

We embed codon sequences (not amino acids) in hyperbolic geometry. On S669, it achieves ρ=0.585 sequence-only, but the failure cases look different from structure-based methods - we fail on buried core mutations, Rosetta fails on charged surface clusters.

Does that pattern suggest orthogonal signal to you, or is this just noise at n=52? Would value your perspective given your benchmarking expertise.

Best,
