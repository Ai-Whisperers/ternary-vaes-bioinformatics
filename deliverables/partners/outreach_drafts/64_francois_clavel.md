**Subject:** Evolutionary constraints on resistance mutations - geometric analysis

---

Dr. Clavel,

Your mechanistic work on HIV resistance shows how structural constraints limit which mutations are viable. We've been exploring whether geometric methods capture similar constraints from sequence data alone.

The approach: embed HIV sequences in hyperbolic space where radial position correlates with evolutionary constraint. Positions closer to the center are more constrained - mutations there should have higher fitness costs.

Question: do resistance mutations tend to occur at structurally permissive positions (our "outer" positions), or do they often require compensatory changes because they hit constrained sites?

If geometric constraint predictions align with your mechanistic findings, it would validate the approach. If not, we're missing something important about how resistance evolves.

Best,
