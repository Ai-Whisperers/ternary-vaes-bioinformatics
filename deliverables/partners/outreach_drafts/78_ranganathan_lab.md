**Subject:** SCA vs. p-adic constraints - capturing different evolutionary signals?

Prof. Ranganathan,

Your statistical coupling work revealed that coevolution encodes functional constraints. We've been exploring a different evolutionary signal: p-adic geometry on codon sequences (not amino acids).

Our VAE embeds codons in hyperbolic space based on 3-adic valuation. This captures hierarchical structure (rho=-0.83 with valuation) that correlates with stability (rho=0.58 on S669 subset (N=52)).

Question: do you think coevolution (pairwise correlations) and p-adic structure (hierarchical constraints) capture the same underlying evolutionary information, or are they likely orthogonal?

If they're orthogonal, combining SCA with p-adic features might improve predictions. If redundant, not worth the complexity.

Would your intuition on this be valuable to hear.

Best,
