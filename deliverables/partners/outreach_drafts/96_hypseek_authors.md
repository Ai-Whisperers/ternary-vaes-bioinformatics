(Use first name once identified),

Your HypSeek paper on hyperbolic embeddings for protein-ligand interactions is exciting - we're applying similar geometry to a different biological problem.

Our domain: codon sequences rather than protein-ligand binding. We embed sequences in Poincare space using p-adic valuation (3-adic structure creates natural hierarchy). Results: rho=-0.83 hierarchy correlation, rho=0.58 stability prediction, AUC=0.67 contact prediction.

Question: in your ligand binding work, does hyperbolic geometry help because binding pockets have hierarchical structure, or for some other geometric reason? Trying to understand when hyperbolic embeddings provide genuine advantage vs. when Euclidean would work equally well.

Would comparing notes on hyperbolic biology be useful?
