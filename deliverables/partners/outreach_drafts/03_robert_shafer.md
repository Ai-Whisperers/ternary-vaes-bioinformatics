**Subject:** HIVdb API integration for TDR screening tool

---

Dr. Shafer,

We've built a transmitted drug resistance screening tool that wraps the Stanford HIVdb Sierra API to batch-process patient sequences for pre-treatment resistance patterns and long-acting injectable (CAB-LA/RPV-LA) eligibility.

The tool is open-source and intended for resource-limited settings where clinicians need to screen cohorts efficiently. We're using it in Paraguay through CONACYT funding.

Two questions:
1. Are there API usage guidelines we should follow for non-commercial academic tools?
2. Would the HIVdb team want to review our mutation interpretation logic before we share it more broadly?

Happy to demo the workflow or share the code for review.

Best,
Ivan Weiss Van Der Pol
