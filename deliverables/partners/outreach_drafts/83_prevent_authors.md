**Subject:** PREVENT question - physics vs. evolution for stability?

(Use first name once identified),

Your PREVENT paper integrates free energy directly into the VAE objective - physics-informed stability. We've taken an orthogonal route: encoding evolutionary constraints via p-adic geometry.

Question: does PREVENT's physics-based approach catch instabilities that evolution-based methods miss, or vice versa? Our sequence-only predictor (rho=0.58 on S669) finds some mutations that Rosetta misses - different error patterns.

Hypothesis: physics captures thermodynamic reality, evolution captures "what has survived." These might be complementary signals.

Would comparing failure modes on the same benchmark reveal whether ensembling physics + evolution methods improves on either alone?
