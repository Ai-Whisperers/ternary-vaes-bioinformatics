Geoopt Maintainers,

Geoopt has been essential for our research - thanks for maintaining it. We've built a production application using PoincareBall and wanted to offer feedback and contributions.

Our usage: p-adic codon embeddings in Poincare ball. Heavy use of poincare_distance(), exp/log maps, and manifold constraints. Results: rho=-0.83 hierarchy correlation, rho=0.58 stability prediction on proteins.

Contributions we could offer:
- Example notebook: biological Poincare application
- Any bugs we've encountered (none so far, actually)
- Documentation on combining geoopt with VAE training

Question: would a biological use case example be useful for the repo? We can adapt to your contribution style.

Thanks again for the library.

Best,
