**Subject:** Offer: MIC predictions for your microbiome AMP candidates

Hi,

Your Cell paper identified thousands of AMP candidates from microbiome data - impressive discovery pipeline. We have a MIC predictor that might help prioritize candidates for experimental validation.

Our model achieves Spearman 0.66 on E. coli MIC and runs fast enough for batch screening. If you have sequences you're considering for synthesis, we could provide activity predictions with confidence intervals.

No strings attached - just offering because it seems useful and we'd be curious which candidates your experiments validate. That feedback would help us improve the model.

Let me know if a few hundred predictions would be helpful.

Best,
