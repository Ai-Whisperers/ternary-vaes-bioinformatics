**Subject:** Hyperbolic latent spaces for protein diffusion?

---

Kevin,

EvoDiff's discrete diffusion approach to protein generation is elegant. Quick question about geometry:

We've been using hyperbolic (Poincaré) latent spaces for protein embeddings. The geometry naturally represents hierarchies - which proteins have. Results: ρ=0.58 for stability prediction, 82.8% ultrametric compliance.

Have you considered non-Euclidean geometries for EvoDiff's latent space? The diffusion would be messier (need Riemannian score matching), but the inductive bias might help.

Curious if you've thought about this or if there's a reason Euclidean is better for diffusion.

Best,
