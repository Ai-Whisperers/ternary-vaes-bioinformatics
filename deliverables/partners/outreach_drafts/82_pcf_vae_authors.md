**Subject:** PCF-VAE question - does hyperbolic geometry also prevent collapse?

---

(Use first name once identified),

Your Nature paper on preventing posterior collapse addresses a fundamental VAE issue. We've noticed something related: our hyperbolic (Poincare) latent space seems naturally resistant to collapse.

Theory: hyperbolic space has exponential volume growth, so the KL penalty behaves differently than in Euclidean space. The latent code has "room" to be informative without fighting the prior.

Question: have you explored whether geometric changes (curved vs. flat space) affect collapse, or is PCF's training modification orthogonal to geometry? If orthogonal, combining PCF with hyperbolic geometry might stack benefits.

Our hyperbolic VAE maintains rho=-0.83 hierarchy without collapse issues. Would understanding the interaction be useful?
