Dr. Koonin,

Your work on genetic code evolution suggests the code has deeper structure than random assignment. We've found mathematical evidence supporting this: p-adic (3-adic) valuation creates a natural hierarchy among the 64 codons.

Our finding: when we embed codon sequences in hyperbolic space using 3-adic valuation, we get 82.8% ultrametric compliance and strong hierarchy correlation (rho=-0.83). This suggests the genetic code has intrinsic tree-like mathematical structure.

Downstream validation: this embedding predicts protein stability (rho=0.58), contacts (AUC=0.67), and force constants (r=0.86) - all from codon-level features, not amino acid.

Question: does the p-adic structure align with your understanding of code evolution? The 3-adic hierarchy might reflect something about how the code was optimized or expanded.

Would your evolutionary perspective on this mathematical finding be valuable to hear.

Best,
