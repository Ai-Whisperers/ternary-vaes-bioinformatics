# Professional Email Standards

## The Golden Rules

### 1. LENGTH: Under 150 words
- Busy researchers skim
- 5-7 sentences maximum
- No tables in the email body
- One clear ask

### 2. SUBJECT LINE: Specific + Intriguing
- BAD: "Collaboration Opportunity"
- BAD: "Novel P-adic Approach to DDG Prediction"
- GOOD: "Question about your ThermoMPNN epistasis paper"
- GOOD: "DENV-4 primer design challenge - your perspective?"

### 3. OPENING: About THEM, not you
- BAD: "Your pioneering work has been foundational..."
- BAD: "We've developed a novel approach..."
- GOOD: "Your 2024 paper on [specific title] addressed [specific finding]..."
- GOOD: "I noticed your lab's work on [specific project]..."

### 4. THE HOOK: One specific, verifiable claim
- BAD: "We achieve state-of-the-art performance"
- GOOD: "We found DENV-4 has only 71.7% sequence identity vs 95%+ for other serotypes"
- GOOD: "Our sequence-only method caught 12 stability changes that Rosetta missed on S669"

### 5. THE ASK: Small and specific
- BAD: "Would you be interested in testing our framework?"
- BAD: "Would you like to collaborate?"
- GOOD: "Would a 15-minute call be useful to see if this is relevant to your work?"
- GOOD: "Is this finding consistent with what you've observed?"
- GOOD: "I'd value your quick take on whether this is worth pursuing."

### 6. SIGNATURE: Team format with credentials

### 7. NO:
- Tables
- Bullet point lists longer than 3 items
- Technical jargon in first email
- License information
- "Dear Prof./Dr." for Americans (use first name)
- Multiple asks
- Attachments

## Example: Brian Kuhlman (GOOD)

```
Subject: Question about ThermoMPNN epistasis findings

Brian,

Your paper on epistatic interactions in stability prediction raised an interesting challenge - current models struggle with double mutations.

We've been testing a sequence-only approach using p-adic embeddings and found it catches some stability changes that Rosetta misses (12 of 52 on S669 subset). Still early, but the failure modes seem different.

Curious whether you've seen similar orthogonal signals in your ThermoMPNN work, or if this sounds like noise.

Would a quick look at our predictions be useful? Happy to share the specific cases.

## Example: Frances Arnold (GOOD)

```
Subject: Codon-level constraints in directed evolution

Prof. Arnold,

I'm exploring whether codon choice (not just amino acid) affects protein fitness in directed evolution libraries. Your lab's ML-guided evolution work is the benchmark here.

We've found that embedding codons in hyperbolic space reveals hierarchical constraints - the geometry predicts stability (ρ=0.58 on S669) without structure.

Have you observed cases where synonymous codon changes affected evolution outcomes? Trying to understand if this signal is real or artifact.

Would value your perspective if you have 2 minutes.

## Finding Real Email Addresses

### Academic:
1. Lab website "People" or "Contact" page
2. Recent paper corresponding author
3. University directory
4. Google Scholar profile → personal website

### Industry:
- Don't cold email. Find someone at a conference or through warm intro.
- LinkedIn InMail as last resort (with mutual connections)

### If no email found:
- Mark as "NEEDS EMAIL RESEARCH" 
- Don't send to generic addresses (they go to spam)

## What Makes Recipients Actually Reply

1. **You read their actual paper** (cite specific figure, finding, or quote)
2. **You have a specific question** they can answer quickly
3. **You're not asking for much** (5 min, not a collaboration)
4. **There's something in it for them** (data, tool, insight)
5. **You're credible** (affiliation, prior work, mutual connection)
6. **Timing is right** (not grant deadline, not conference week)
