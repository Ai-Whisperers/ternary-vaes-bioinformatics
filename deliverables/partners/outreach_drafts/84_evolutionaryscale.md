**Subject:** Lightweight complementary features for ESM-3?

---

EvolutionaryScale Team,

ESM-3 is state-of-the-art for protein representations. We've built something complementary: lightweight hyperbolic embeddings that capture hierarchical structure ESM's Euclidean space might miss.

Our approach runs on consumer GPU and achieves rho=0.58 stability prediction, rho=-0.83 hierarchy correlation. Different from ESM: codon-level (not amino acid), hyperbolic geometry, p-adic structure.

Practical question: would small complementary features be useful alongside ESM-3, or does ESM-3's scale already capture everything? Specifically interested in whether hierarchical evolutionary relationships (which hyperbolic space represents efficiently) are already implicit in ESM attention patterns.

If someone evaluates complementary tools, I'd appreciate an intro.

Best,
