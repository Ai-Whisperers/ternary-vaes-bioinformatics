**Subject:** Poincare embeddings for codons - biological application of your framework

---

Max,

Your Poincare embeddings paper provided the foundation for our biological application. We've combined your framework with p-adic number theory for codon sequences.

The key insight: p-adic valuation creates exactly the tree structure that Poincare space represents efficiently. For 19,683 ternary operations (3^9 codon encodings), we achieve rho=-0.83 hierarchy correlation and 82.8% ultrametric compliance.

Downstream results on proteins: stability prediction rho=0.58, contact prediction AUC=0.67. The geometry does real work.

Question: have you seen other applications where algebraic structure (like p-adic) provides the hierarchy that hyperbolic space encodes? Or is this combination unusual?

Would discussing this biological application of your work be interesting?

Best,
