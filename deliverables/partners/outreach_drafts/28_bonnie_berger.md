Prof. Berger,

Your work on mathematical foundations of computational biology made me want to ask about an approach we're using.

We embed biological sequences in hyperbolic space using p-adic number theory - specifically, 3-adic valuation gives natural hierarchy for codon sequences. The Poincaré ball then represents this hierarchy geometrically.

Results: ρ=-0.83 correlation between radial position and p-adic valuation, 82.8% ultrametric compliance. Downstream: stability prediction (ρ=0.58 (N=52), N=52), contact prediction (AUC=0.67).

Is there mathematical theory on when this p-adic → hyperbolic mapping should preserve structure? Trying to understand if our results are theoretically expected or just empirically lucky.

Best,
