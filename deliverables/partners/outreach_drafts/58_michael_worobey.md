**Subject:** DENV-4 diversity anomaly - ancient lineage evidence?

---

Michael,

Your molecular archaeology reconstructions are remarkably precise. Found something in dengue that might interest you from an evolutionary history perspective.

DENV-4 has 71.7% sequence identity across known strains vs. 95-98% for DENV-1/2/3. That's a huge difference in within-serotype diversity.

Two hypotheses: (1) DENV-4 split from the others much earlier than typically assumed, giving more time to accumulate diversity, or (2) DENV-4 has different population dynamics or selection pressures.

From your pandemic origins work, you'd know how to distinguish these. Does this level of diversity difference suggest deep divergence, or are there other explanations? The standard dengue phylogenies don't seem to capture this asymmetry.

Would you have thoughts on how to test the "ancient lineage" hypothesis?

Best,
