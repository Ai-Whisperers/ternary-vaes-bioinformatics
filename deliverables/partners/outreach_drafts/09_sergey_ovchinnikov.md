**Subject:** Coevolution signals in hyperbolic space?

---

Sergey,

Your work democratizing structure prediction (ColabFold!) and understanding coevolution signals is exactly what I want to ask about.

We're embedding sequences in hyperbolic space using p-adic structure and getting stability predictions (ρ=0.58) without alignments. The question: is this capturing something related to coevolution, or something orthogonal?

The hyperbolic geometry enforces ultrametric-like distances (82.8% compliance), which feels related to phylogenetic relationships, but I'm not sure if that connects to the coevolution signal you've characterized.

Any intuition on whether these could be related or distinct signals?

Best,
