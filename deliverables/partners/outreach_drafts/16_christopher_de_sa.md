**Subject:** Biological application of hyperbolic embeddings - quick theoretical question

---

Chris,

Your theoretical work on hyperbolic ML is exactly what I'm trying to understand better. We've been applying Poincaré embeddings to biological sequences (codons) and getting results I can't fully explain theoretically.

Setup: 19,683 ternary operations (3^9) embedded in 16-dim Poincaré ball using a VAE. The p-adic valuation gives natural hierarchy.

Results: -0.832 correlation between radial position and p-adic valuation, 82.8% ultrametric compliance.

Question: Is there theoretical work on when VAE training in hyperbolic space should recover the "true" hierarchy from data? Trying to understand if our results are expected or lucky.

Best,
