**Subject:** DENV-4 primer design problem - 97.4% of genome has no conserved windows

---

Kristian,

Ran into something odd designing pan-dengue primers for surveillance. DENV-4 has dramatically lower conservation than other serotypes - 71.7% identity vs. 95%+ for DENV-1/2/3.

This means 97.4% of the DENV-4 genome has no windows conserved enough for reliable primers. Standard degenerate primer approaches would need ~322M variants to cover known DENV-4 diversity.

We've been using hyperbolic embeddings to identify the few truly conserved regions, but I'm wondering if you've encountered this in your surveillance work. Is DENV-4 just harder to detect, or am I missing something about how labs handle this?

If it's a known problem, curious how diagnostic panels deal with it.

Best,
