**Subject:** Hyperbolic embeddings for phylodynamics - meaningful or just geometry?

---

Prof. Pybus,

Your phylodynamics work on arboviruses connects evolutionary patterns to epidemiological dynamics. We've been exploring whether hyperbolic geometry offers useful perspectives here.

The idea: phylogenetic trees naturally embed in hyperbolic space (exponential growth of leaves matches hyperbolic volume). We've built continuous hyperbolic embeddings of viral sequences that preserve hierarchical relationships.

For DENV, we found serotype 4 has unusually high diversity (71.7% identity vs 95%+ for others). The hyperbolic embedding captures this as greater spread from the origin.

My question: is this geometric view adding anything useful, or just a different visualization of the same information? You'd know better than most whether this captures real phylodynamic signal.

Best,
