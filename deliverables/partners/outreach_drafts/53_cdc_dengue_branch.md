**Subject:** Question about CDC dengue primers - DENV-4 coverage?

---

Hi,

Analyzing dengue diversity for primer design, we found something that might be relevant to CDC diagnostics: DENV-4 has significantly lower sequence conservation than other serotypes.

The numbers: DENV-4 shows 71.7% average identity across sequences vs. 95-98% for DENV-1/2/3. This means primers designed from consensus DENV-4 sequences may miss divergent variants.

Question: Do current CDC dengue RT-PCR assays show differential sensitivity across serotypes? If DENV-4 detection is lower, this diversity might explain it.

We've designed primers targeting DENV-4's few highly conserved regions. Happy to share if useful for validation against your primer sets.

Best,
