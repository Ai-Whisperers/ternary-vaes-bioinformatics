Prof. Lashuel,

Your work on peptide self-assembly and amyloid formation raises an issue we haven't adequately addressed in antimicrobial peptide design - aggregation propensity.

We optimize AMPs for activity and low hemolysis, but don't currently filter for aggregation-prone sequences. Given your expertise, I'm wondering: are there sequence features from amyloid research that translate to short antimicrobial peptides (12-25 aa)?

Specifically, would hydrophobic stretches that help membrane disruption also promote unwanted aggregation? If so, there might be an inherent design tradeoff we're not capturing.

Any pointers to relevant literature would be appreciated.

Best,
