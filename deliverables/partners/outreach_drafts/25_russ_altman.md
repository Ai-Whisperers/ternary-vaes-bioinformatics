**Subject:** VUS stability triage - useful for PharmGKB workflow?

---

Prof. Altman,

PharmGKB's variant annotation work involves triaging VUS. I'm wondering if stability prediction could help prioritize which variants to investigate further.

We've built a sequence-only stability predictor (ρ=0.58 on S669 subset (N=52)) that's fast enough to screen large VUS lists. The idea: flag variants likely to affect protein stability for closer attention.

Questions:
1. Would predicted stability impact be useful as a VUS triage feature?
2. What confidence threshold would be needed for clinical utility?

Trying to understand if this fits into pharmacogenomics workflows.

Best,
