**To:** (via Asimov)

**Subject:** Quick stability filter question - sequence-only screening for design pipelines?

Alex,

Asimov's protein design work is impressive. Quick question from someone building complementary tools.

We've developed a sequence-only stability predictor using hyperbolic geometry (rho=0.58 on S669). It catches some destabilizing mutations that Rosetta misses - different failure modes.

Practical question: in industrial design pipelines, is there value in fast sequence-only filtering before more expensive physics-based validation? Or does structure-aware screening already handle this well enough?

Trying to understand if "orthogonal signal" actually matters when you have good structural methods.

Would your team's perspective on this be useful to hear?

Best,
