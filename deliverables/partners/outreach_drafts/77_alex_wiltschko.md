## EMAIL

**To:** press@osmo.ai (or via LinkedIn direct message)

**Subject:** Computational approaches to molecular embedding - olfaction meets protein geometry?

Alex,

I was a neuroscience postdoc before pivoting to ML, so Osmo's mission to digitize smell resonates. Your work on molecular→perception mapping is fascinating.

We've built something in a different molecular domain: p-adic hyperbolic embeddings for protein sequences. The geometry captures hierarchical structure that correlates with stability (rho=0.58).

Curious whether olfactory molecular space has similar hierarchical structure. Chemical families form natural trees - does your Olfactory Intelligence platform exploit this, or does the perception mapping break the hierarchy?

Would love to compare notes on molecular embedding approaches if you ever have time.

Best,
