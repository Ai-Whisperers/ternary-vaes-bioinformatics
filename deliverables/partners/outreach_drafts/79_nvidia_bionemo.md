**Subject:** Hyperbolic protein embeddings - potential BioNeMo integration?

---

BioNeMo Team,

Your platform makes protein language models accessible at scale. We've developed complementary embeddings using hyperbolic geometry that might fill a gap.

Our approach embeds codon sequences (not amino acids) in Poincare space using p-adic structure. This captures hierarchical evolutionary relationships that Euclidean embeddings distort. Results: stability prediction rho=0.58, contact prediction AUC=0.67.

Technical question: would lightweight hyperbolic embeddings (runs on consumer GPU) complement BioNeMo's transformer-based representations? Different inductive biases might provide orthogonal features for downstream tasks.

If there's a developer relations contact who evaluates community integrations, I'd appreciate an intro.

Best,
