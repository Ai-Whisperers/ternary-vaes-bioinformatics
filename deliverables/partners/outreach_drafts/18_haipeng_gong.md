**Subject:** Geometric deep learning - algebraic vs. differential geometry?

---

Prof. Gong,

Your GeoDDG uses differential geometry (3D coordinates) for stability prediction. We've been trying something different - algebraic geometry (p-adic numbers) on sequences.

Our approach: embed codons in hyperbolic space using 3-adic valuation. Result: ρ=0.585 on S669, sequence-only. No structure needed, but obviously less information.

Question: Would you expect these to capture orthogonal information? Differential geometry sees local atomic packing; algebraic geometry sees evolutionary hierarchy. Or are they ultimately correlated through some shared signal?

Curious for your geometric perspective.

Best,
