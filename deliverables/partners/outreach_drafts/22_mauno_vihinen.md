Prof. Vihinen,

Your VariBench work sets rigorous standards for variant prediction evaluation. I'd value your guidance on a methodological question.

We have a stability predictor that achieves ρ=0.585 on S669 using sequence-only features (codon embeddings in hyperbolic space). But our validation is on n=52 protein-specific LOO test.

Questions:
1. At this sample size, what's the risk of overfitting even with LOO?
2. Which additional benchmarks would you recommend for stability prediction?
3. Are there obvious confounders I should control for?

Trying to be rigorous before claiming anything.

Best,
