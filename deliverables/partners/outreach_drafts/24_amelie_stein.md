**Subject:** Sequence-only complement to PRISM?

Dr. Stein,

PRISM provides valuable structure-based stability predictions. I'm wondering if a sequence-only method might be useful for cases where structure isn't available.

We embed codon sequences in hyperbolic space and get ρ=0.585 on S669 - lower than structure-based methods, but applicable to any sequence. The interesting observation: our failure cases differ from Rosetta-based predictions.

Two questions:
1. Do you see demand for sequence-only predictions as a quick first filter?
2. Would combining structure-based and sequence-based predictions improve coverage, or are they too correlated?

Best,
