**Subject:** Your INSTI resistance paper - question about cabotegravir predictions

(Use first name once identified),

Your bioRxiv work on INSTI resistance prediction is timely with CAB-LA rollout. We've built a complementary tool using p-adic geometry for LA injectable eligibility screening.

Specific question: does your model distinguish between dolutegravir and cabotegravir resistance patterns? The clinical threshold for CAB-LA eligibility is more conservative, and we're trying to understand whether sequence features capture this difference.

Our tool integrates Stanford HIVdb but adds geometric features from codon-level embeddings. If your approach captures INSTI-specific patterns ours misses, ensemble methods might improve both.

Would a quick comparison on public sequences be useful?

Best,
