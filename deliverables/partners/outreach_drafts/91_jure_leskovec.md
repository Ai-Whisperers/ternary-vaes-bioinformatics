**Subject:** Implicit graphs from p-adic structure - GNN-like without explicit edges?

---

Jure,

Your GNN work extracts hierarchical structure from explicit graph topology. We've found something related: p-adic valuation on sequences creates implicit tree structure without constructing edges.

Our approach embeds codon sequences in Poincare space using 3-adic valuation. The valuation defines parent-child relationships algebraically. Results: rho=-0.83 hierarchy correlation, rho=0.58 stability prediction.

Question: is the p-adic tree structure essentially equivalent to running a GNN on the implicit valuation graph, or does the algebraic approach capture different information? Trying to understand when explicit graph construction is necessary vs. when algebraic structure suffices.

Would your intuition on this graph-vs-algebra tradeoff be useful to hear.

Best,
