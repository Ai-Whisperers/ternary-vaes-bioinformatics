**Subject:** Codon vs. amino acid in directed evolution libraries

Prof. Arnold,

Quick question from our work on protein fitness prediction: we're finding signal in codon choice, not just amino acid identity.

When you design directed evolution libraries, do you typically control for synonymous codons, or let them vary? We're seeing stability-relevant information at the codon level (ρ=0.58 on DDG prediction), and wondering if directed evolution experiments have shown codon effects on fitness.

Mostly curious if this matches your empirical observations, or if codon effects would be swamped by amino acid effects in typical evolution experiments.

Best,
