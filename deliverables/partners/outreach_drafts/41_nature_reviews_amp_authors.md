Hi,

Your Nature Reviews piece on ML for AMP design was comprehensive - great reference for the field. Noticed you covered the major architecture types but p-adic/hyperbolic approaches weren't included (probably because they're new and weird).

We've been testing hyperbolic embeddings for AMP activity prediction and getting reasonable results (Spearman 0.66 for MIC). The idea is that ultrametric geometry better captures hierarchical constraints than Euclidean space.

Not suggesting a correction - just flagging an alternative approach that might be worth mentioning if you do updates or follow-up pieces. Happy to share details if useful for your work.

Best,

## Notes

- **Word count:** 118
- **Why this works:** Humble approach ("new and weird"), doesn't demand inclusion, offers value
- **Tone:** Casual (review authors likely academics)
