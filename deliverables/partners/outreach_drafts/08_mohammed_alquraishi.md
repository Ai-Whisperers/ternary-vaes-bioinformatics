**Subject:** Hyperbolic geometry for protein embeddings?

Mohammed,

Your work on end-to-end differentiable structure prediction and protein representations is impressive. Quick question on embedding geometry:

We've been experimenting with hyperbolic (Poincaré ball) latent spaces for protein VAEs instead of Euclidean. The idea is that hyperbolic space naturally represents hierarchies, and protein families are hierarchical.

Results: stability prediction ρ=0.58 (sequence-only), ultrametric compliance 82.8%. But implementation is messier than Euclidean.

Have you considered non-Euclidean geometries in your models? Curious whether you think the theoretical benefits justify the engineering overhead, or if there's a reason it hasn't caught on.

Best,
