**Subject:** Question about ThermoMPNN epistasis findings

Brian,

Your paper on epistatic interactions in stability prediction raised a challenge I've been thinking about - current models struggle with double mutations because they miss correlated effects.

We've been testing a sequence-only approach using hyperbolic embeddings and found it catches some stability changes that Rosetta's ddg_monomer misses (12 of 52 cases on an S669 subset where methods disagree). The failure modes look different - ours fails on buried hydrophobic changes, Rosetta fails on surface charge clusters.

Curious whether you've seen similar orthogonal error patterns in ThermoMPNN, or if this is likely just noise at our sample size.

Happy to share the specific discordant cases if useful.

Best,
