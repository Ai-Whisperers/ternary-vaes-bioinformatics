**Subject:** DENV-4 diversity vs. other serotypes - your clinical perspective?

---

Prof. Harris,

Your Nicaragua dengue cohort provides unique long-term clinical data. I wanted to ask about something we found that might affect diagnostic primers.

In sequence analysis, DENV-4 shows much higher diversity than other serotypes (71.7% identity vs. 95%+ for DENV-1/2/3). This means standard degenerate primer approaches may miss some DENV-4 variants.

From your clinical surveillance: have you seen cases where DENV-4 was harder to detect by RT-PCR, or variants that escaped standard primers? Trying to understand if this sequence diversity translates to diagnostic gaps in the field.

Best,
