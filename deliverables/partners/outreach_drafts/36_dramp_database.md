## EMAIL

**To:** dramp@cpu.edu.cn

**Subject:** MIC predictions for DRAMP entries - potential contribution?

---

Dear DRAMP Team,

DRAMP has been invaluable for our antimicrobial peptide research. We trained a MIC predictor on publicly available data including DRAMP and achieved r=0.39 (p<0.001) on held-out E. coli data (N=105). Performance varies by pathogen - E. coli and Acinetobacter work best.

We could contribute predicted MIC values for DRAMP entries that currently lack experimental activity data. This might help users prioritize candidates for experimental validation.

Would this kind of computational annotation be useful for the database? We could provide:
- Predicted MIC values with confidence intervals
- Batch predictions for entries missing activity data
- Source code for reproducibility

Happy to discuss data format and attribution.

Best,
