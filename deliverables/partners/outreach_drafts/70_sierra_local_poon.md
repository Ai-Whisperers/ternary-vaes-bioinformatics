**Subject:** Sierra-local + p-adic features - worth combining?

Art,

Your Sierra-local implementation is exactly what labs need for local HIVdb analysis. We've built complementary tools using a different approach (hyperbolic embeddings) and wondered about potential synergies.

Our tools:
- TDR screening with Stanford HIVdb integration
- LA injectable eligibility assessment
- Batch sequence processing

The difference: our features come from p-adic geometry (ultrametric embedding of codon space) rather than standard sequence descriptors. This might capture different evolutionary signals.

Question from one open-source HIV tool developer to another: is there value in combining approaches? If p-adic features add predictive power beyond what HIVdb captures, integration might help. If they're redundant, no point.

Would a quick benchmarking comparison be interesting?

Best,
