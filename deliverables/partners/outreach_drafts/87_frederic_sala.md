Fred,

Your work on when hyperbolic representations help is exactly the theory we need. We've applied hyperbolic geometry to biological sequences and want to understand if our approach is principled or lucky.

Our setup: p-adic valuation on ternary operations (3^9 = 19,683 codon encodings) creates a natural tree structure. We embed this in Poincare space using the valuation as hierarchy. Results: rho=-0.83 hierarchy correlation, rho=0.58 stability prediction.

Question: does p-adic valuation provide exactly the kind of hierarchical structure where hyperbolic embedding provably helps? Or could the same results come from good Euclidean embeddings?

Trying to understand if we're using the right geometry for the right reasons.

Best,
