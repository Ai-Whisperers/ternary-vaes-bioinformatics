**Subject:** Comparing APD3 predictions with hyperbolic embeddings

---

Dr. Wang,

APD has been foundational for the AMP field. The activity prediction tools on APD3 use physicochemical descriptors - we've been testing a different approach using hyperbolic geometric embeddings.

Our method achieves similar accuracy (Spearman ~0.66 for MIC) but derives features from codon-level structure rather than amino acid properties. This suggests the two approaches might capture different aspects of activity.

Would you be interested in a benchmark comparison? We could test both methods on the same holdout set and see if combining predictions improves accuracy. If the error modes are independent, an ensemble might outperform either alone.

Best,
