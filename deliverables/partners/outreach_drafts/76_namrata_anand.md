**Subject:** Diffusion vs. hyperbolic VAE - do they capture different stability signals?

Namrata,

Your protein diffusion work generates impressive structures. We've been exploring something complementary - hyperbolic VAEs that embed codons (not amino acids) in Poincare space. Very different inductive bias.

Quick question: in your structure generation, do you observe that some sequences with good structural predictions still fail experimentally on stability? We're finding our sequence-only approach (rho=0.58 on S669 subset (N=52)) catches some cases that physics-based methods miss.

Wondering if diffusion models have similar blind spots, or if the structure-aware approach handles stability differently.

Would a 10-minute comparison of failure modes be interesting?

Best,
