**Subject:** Geometric forecasting vs. your population genetics approach - same signal?

Sarah,

Your work predicting viral evolution uses population genetics theory. We've been testing hyperbolic geometric embeddings for similar predictions and wondering if we're capturing the same information differently or different information entirely.

The geometric approach: embed sequences in hyperbolic space where radial position correlates with evolutionary constraint. Changes moving "outward" represent relaxed constraint; "inward" represents tightening.

For dengue, we see DENV-4 embedded further from the origin than other serotypes (71.7% diversity vs 95%+). This might reflect different selection regimes - which your population genetics framework could test directly.

Question: do geometric predictions add anything your methods don't already capture? Or is this just a different visualization of the same evolutionary signal?

Curious about your perspective as someone who's thought deeply about viral forecasting.

Best,
