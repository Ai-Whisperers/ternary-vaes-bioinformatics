**Subject:** START cohort question - TDR prevalence at enrollment?

Prof. Lundgren,

The START trial fundamentally changed HIV treatment guidelines. We've built a TDR screening tool and have a data question about the cohort.

Was transmitted drug resistance measured at enrollment in START? If so, did baseline TDR affect the early vs. deferred treatment outcome difference? Intuitively, early treatment should provide more benefit when TDR is absent, but I haven't found published subgroup analysis.

Our tool screens sequences using Stanford HIVdb integration plus p-adic features. If START enrollment data exists with TDR annotations, understanding the relationship between baseline resistance and treatment benefit would be valuable for calibration.

Any pointers to published resistance data from START would be helpful.

Best,
