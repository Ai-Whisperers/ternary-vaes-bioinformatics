**Subject:** Open-source TDR screening tools - available for IAS community

---

Dear IAS,

We've developed open-source HIV resistance screening tools integrating Stanford HIVdb. Wanted to make them available to the IAS research community.

The tools:
- **TDR screening** for pre-treatment resistance
- **LA injectable eligibility** for cabotegravir/rilpivirine
- **Batch processing** for cohort analysis

They're free for academic/research use (PolyForm Noncommercial license) and could support resistance surveillance studies or clinical trials.

Question: what's the best way to make tools visible to IAS members? Should we submit an abstract to IAS 2026, or is there a community resources section?
