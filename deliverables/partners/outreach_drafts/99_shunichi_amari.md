**Subject:** Information geometry perspective on p-adic embeddings - seeking guidance

Prof. Amari,

Your foundational work on information geometry shapes how we think about statistical manifolds. We've developed an approach combining hyperbolic geometry with p-adic algebra, and respectfully seek your perspective on a theoretical question.

Our framework embeds codon sequences in Poincare space using 3-adic valuation. Results: rho=-0.83 hierarchy correlation, 82.8% ultrametric compliance. The negative curvature seems to match the ultrametric structure naturally.

Question: from an information geometry viewpoint, is there a principled connection between p-adic (ultrametric) structure and hyperbolic (negative curvature) manifolds? Or is our empirical success coincidental rather than theoretically grounded?

We would be honored by any guidance on understanding this connection.

Best,
