**Subject:** Hyperbolic VAE vs. hyperbolic GNN - different hierarchy sources?

---

Ines,

Your hyperbolic GNN work uses graph structure to derive hierarchy for embedding. We've taken a different route: deriving hierarchy from p-adic valuation on sequences (no graph needed).

Our approach embeds codon sequences in Poincare space using 3-adic valuation as the hierarchical signal. Results: rho=-0.83 hierarchy correlation, rho=0.58 stability prediction.

Question: does the source of hierarchy (explicit graph vs. algebraic structure) matter for downstream performance, or does hyperbolic geometry help regardless of where the tree structure comes from?

Understanding this would clarify when hyperbolic VAEs can substitute for hyperbolic GNNs.

Would a quick comparison be useful?

Best,
