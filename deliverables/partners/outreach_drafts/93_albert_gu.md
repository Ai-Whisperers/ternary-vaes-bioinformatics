**Subject:** S4 question - p-adic geometry as another mathematical basis for sequences?

---

Albert,

Your S4 and Mamba work showed that linear systems theory provides elegant sequence modeling. We've found a different mathematical structure that also works: p-adic number theory + hyperbolic geometry.

Comparison: S4 uses polynomial approximation and recurrence. Our approach uses 3-adic valuation to create tree structure, then embeds in Poincare space. No recurrence - just geometry.

Results: rho=-0.83 hierarchy correlation, rho=0.58 stability prediction, all from codon embeddings.

Question: from your deep understanding of sequence modeling mathematics, do p-adic/ultrametric structures and state space models capture fundamentally different sequence properties? Or might they be different realizations of the same underlying capability?

Curious about your theoretical perspective.

Best,
