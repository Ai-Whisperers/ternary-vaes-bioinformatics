**Subject:** P-adic features vs. QSAR descriptors - orthogonal signal?

---

Artem,

Your QSAR work on AMPs uses physicochemical descriptors that have proven robust across datasets. We've been testing a different feature space - codon-based hyperbolic embeddings - and getting decent MIC correlations (0.66 Spearman).

Curious whether you've explored feature combinations where different descriptor types capture independent variance. Our features are derived from evolutionary/coding structure rather than chemistry, so the error modes might be complementary.

Would a quick comparison on a shared dataset be interesting? We could see if ensemble predictions improve.

Best,
