# Ternary VAE Bioinformatics: Partnership Overview

**Tier 1: Executive Briefing**

---

## 1. The Vision

**To revolutionize biological engineering by replacing discrete guesswork with continuous geometric precision.**

- **The Problem:** Biology is discrete (A, C, G, T) and combinatorial (too many possibilities).
- **The Solution:** Embed biology into **Continuous Hyperbolic Space** using **Ternary VAEs**.
- **The Result:** We don't "search" for cures; we calculate them using gradients.

## 2. The Core Technology Stack

### A. Ternary VAEs

- **What:** A generative AI that understands the "grammar" of DNA/Proteins.
- **Why:** It compresses billions of years of evolution into a navigatable map.

### B. Hyperbolic Geometry

- **What:** The geometry of trees and hierarchies.
- **Why:** Biology isn't flat (Euclidean). Hyperbolic space captures the true structure of evolution (phylogeny), allowing 100x more accurate predictions.

## 3. Strategic Partnerships

We are validating this technology through three pilot programs with world-class experts.

### 🧬 Project Alpha: The Peptide Foundry

- **Lead:** Dr. Carlos Brizuela (CICESE)
- **Goal:** Design new antibiotics (AMPS) that kill bacteria but spare human cells.
- **Tech:** Latent Space Multi-Objective Optimization.

### 📡 Project Beta: Phylogenetic Radar

- **Lead:** Alejandra Rojas (IICS-UNA)
- **Goal:** Predict Dengue outbreaks years in advance.
- **Tech:** Hyperbolic Trajectory Forecasting.

### 🧩 Project Gamma: Geometric QC

- **Lead:** Dr. José Colbes (UNA/CONACYT)
- **Goal:** Ensure engineered proteins will actually fold and function.
- **Tech:** P-adic Stability Scoring.

## 4. Current Status

- **Phase 1 (Planning):** Complete.
- **Phase 2 (Scaffolding):** Complete. Modular Python packages created for all partners.
- **Phase 3 (Implementation):** Ready to launch.

## 5. The "Moonshot" Future

Beyond these pilots, we are planning:

- **"Trojan Horse" Peptides** for intracellular superbugs.
- **Pre-emptive Vaccines** for viruses that don't exist yet.
- **Quantum Protein Packing** for massive viral capsids.
