Good. This is the **right move after a clean falsification**: stop asking the model to invent signal, and instead **enumerate what pathogen-specific information could even exist**, then test each hypothesis with **real inference**, not mocks.

Below is a **minimal, concrete batch of conjectures**, all **implementable with current data or light extensions**, each paired with **how to falsify it**. No wet-lab, no hand-waving.

---

## Conjecture Class 1: Pathogen specificity is **contextual, not intrinsic**

**Claim**
MIC is not peptide→pathogen specific in isolation; it is peptide×environment specific.

**Usable signal**
• pH
• ionic strength
• serum presence
• membrane stress state proxies

**Why trivial**
You already model context for gut vs skin. This is the same axis, just finer.

**Test**
Train MIC predictors conditioned on `(peptide, context)` and check:
• MIC variance across pathogens **within fixed context** → should stay low
• MIC variance across contexts **for same pathogen** → should increase

**Falsifies if**
Context conditioning does not change MIC separability at all.

## Conjecture Class 2: Pathogen specificity lives in **failure modes**, not mean MIC

**Claim**
Pathogens differ in *how* peptides fail (resistance, tolerance), not in average MIC.

**Usable signal**
• predicted resistance likelihood
• membrane repair proxies
• stress response induction scores (indirect, learned)

**Why trivial**
Reframe objective from MIC mean → MIC tail / failure probability.

**Test**
Predict:
• P(MIC > threshold | peptide, pathogen)
instead of E[MIC].

**Falsifies if**
Failure distributions overlap completely across pathogens.

---

## Conjecture Class 3: Pathogen specificity is **sequence-conditional, not global**

**Claim**
Only specific peptide submanifolds exhibit pathogen differentiation.

**Usable signal**
• peptide clusters (latent space regions)
• length / charge regimes
• secondary structure regimes

**Why trivial**
You already do regime analysis.

**Test**
Condition MIC models on `(cluster_id, peptide)` and test:
• differentiation exists **only inside certain clusters**

**Falsifies if**
No cluster shows above-noise pathogen separation.

---

## Conjecture Class 4: DRAMP encodes **activity priors**, not mechanisms

**Claim**
DRAMP signal is useful only as a constraint, not as a differentiator.

**Usable signal**
• DRAMP as feasibility filter
• not as regression target

**Why trivial**
You already separated it into Pareto space.

**Test**
Use DRAMP only to reject infeasible peptides, then re-train MIC purely on VAE features.

**Falsifies if**
Removing DRAMP collapses even global MIC ordering.

---

## Conjecture Class 5: Pathogen specificity requires **non-AMP information**

**Claim**
MIC specificity requires signals not present in peptide-only data.

**Usable signal**
• pathogen membrane composition class (coarse)
• Gram status is insufficient, but subclasses may help
• biofilm vs planktonic proxy

**Why trivial**
These are categorical variables, not new experiments.

**Test**
Add pathogen metadata as inputs and test:
• does MIC separation appear **only when metadata is present**?

**Falsifies if**
Metadata adds no predictive power.

---

## Conjecture Class 6: Pathogen specificity is **non-scalar**

**Claim**
MIC is the wrong observable. Directional effects exist that collapse under scalarization.

**Usable signal**
• growth delay vs kill
• bacteriostatic vs bactericidal proxy labels

**Why trivial**
Reframe outputs, no new data.

**Test**
Multi-head prediction: different response modes instead of one MIC.

**Falsifies if**
All heads collapse to identical predictions.

---

## Conjecture Class 7: Specificity emerges only under **conditional activation**

**Claim**
Static peptides cannot be pathogen-specific; conditional peptides can.

**Usable signal**
• protease motifs
• pH-activated folding
• density-dependent cooperativity

**Why trivial**
This is architectural, not experimental.

**Test**
Simulate conditional activation gates and test whether specificity appears **only when gating is enabled**.

**Falsifies if**
Even gated models show no separation.

---

## How to run this correctly (important)

• **No ensembling tricks**
• **No weight tuning to “make it work”**
• Each conjecture must either:
– produce signal, or
– fail cleanly and be documented

Negative results are **outputs**, not errors.

## What success looks like BEFORE IMPLEMENTING IMPROVEMENTS TO THE AI MODEL

Not “we solved pathogen-specific MIC”, but:

> “We identified which classes of information are necessary and sufficient for pathogen-specific activity, and which are provably insufficient under current data.”

That’s platform-level insight.

## One-line meta insight

You’re no longer optimizing peptides.
You’re mapping **where biological information actually lives**.
