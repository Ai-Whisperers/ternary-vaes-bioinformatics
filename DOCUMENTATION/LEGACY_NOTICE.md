# Legacy Documentation Notice

> **This folder contains legacy documentation. Please use `docs/content/` for current documentation.**

---

## New Documentation Location

All documentation has been consolidated and reorganized in:

**[`docs/content/`](../docs/content/README.md)**

---

## Why This Change?

The legacy DOCUMENTATION folder had:
- 578 markdown files
- 195 directories
- Up to 7 levels of nesting
- Significant content duplication

The new structure has:
- ~30 well-organized files
- 3 levels maximum
- Single source of truth for each topic
- Clear navigation
