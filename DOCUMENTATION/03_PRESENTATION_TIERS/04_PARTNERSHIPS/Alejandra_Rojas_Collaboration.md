## 2️⃣ The Collaboration Opportunity: "Computational Virology"

| IICS-UNA Expertise (Wet Lab)                                               | Ternary VAE Expertise (Dry Lab)                                                 | Synergistic Outlet                                                                      |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Genomic Data Generation**<br>(MinION sequencing of local variants)       | **Hyperbolic VAE Engines**<br>(Latent space visualization of viral evolution)   | **Predictive Surveillance:**<br>Identifying "Variants of Concern" before they dominate. |
| **Low-Cost Diagnostics**<br>(Affordable ELISAs & rRT-PCR)                  | **Optimized Probe Design**<br>(P-adic Hamming distance for specificity)         | **Enhanced Sensitivity:**<br>Designing primers that resist viral mutation escape.       |
| **Infrastructure Constraints**<br>(Need for ambient storage/offline tools) | **Offline-First Engineering**<br>(Winget-deployable, local-first architectures) | **Resilient Field Ops:**<br>Deploying our AI tools directly to mobile labs.             |

## 3️⃣ Proposed Pilot Project: "Retrospective VAE Analysis"

**Goal:** Apply our **Ternary VAE** (Hyperbolic/P-adic) models to the retrospective genomic datasets generated by her NIH grants (2011-2024 Dengue/SARS-CoV-2).

- **Objective A:** Train a custom VAE on Paraguayan viral sequences.
- **Objective B:** Map the "Hyperbolic Trajectory" of the 2011 Dengue epidemic vs. the 2019-2024 outbreaks.
- **Objective C:** Validate if VAE latent coordinates correlate with the "Severe Dengue" clinical markers she identified.

> **Speaker Note:** Low-risk, high-reward. We use existing data to prove the value of our model.

## 4️⃣ Strategic Alignment with "Open Medicine"

Our project's **Open Medicine Policy** (CC-BY-4.0 / PolyForm-Noncommercial) aligns perfectly with her focus on **public health equity**:

1.  **No Vendor Lock-in:** Our tools are open source, continuously deployable via standard package managers.
2.  **Cost Reduction:** Our algorithms run on consumer hardware (Gaming GPUs), avoiding expensive cloud fees.
3.  **Local Sovereignty:** Data stays at IICS-UNA; we bring the code to the data.

---

## 5️⃣ Executive Next Steps

1.  **Formalize Data Sharing:** Sign a specific agreement for the retrospective Dengue dataset.
2.  **Deploy "Ternary VAE" Locally:** Setup a pilot workstation at IICS-UNA (or remote access) to run the analysis.
3.  **Joint Grant Application:** Target the next NIH "GlobalInfectious Disease" cycle with a "Computational+Genomic" combined proposal.

> **Speaker Note:** Close with a concrete action plan. The "Joint Grant" is the long-term carrot.
