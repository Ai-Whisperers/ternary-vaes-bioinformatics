> **Public-facing materials for scientists, clinicians, and media.**

---

## Purpose

Tier 1 contains documentation suitable for broad distribution to:
- Academic researchers and collaborators
- Clinicians and virologists
- Science journalists and media
- Conference attendees
- General public with scientific interest

**Key principle**: All content is externally validated (Level 2+) and uses accessible language without proprietary terminology.
