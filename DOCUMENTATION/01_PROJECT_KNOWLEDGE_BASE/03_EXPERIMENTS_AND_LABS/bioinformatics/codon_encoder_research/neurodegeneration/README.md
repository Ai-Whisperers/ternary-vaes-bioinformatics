## Overview

This directory contains exploratory research on neurodegenerative diseases using 3-adic hyperbolic codon geometry. Current focus is on Alzheimer's disease and tau phosphorylation patterns.

---

## Research Status

**Status:** Early Stage Exploration

This research domain is in its initial phases, applying the same 3-adic geometric framework proven effective for HIV and autoimmune disease to neurodegeneration.

## Hypothesis

Tau phosphorylation sites exhibit p-adic clustering patterns similar to citrullination in rheumatoid arthritis. The "Goldilocks Zone" model may predict which phosphorylation events trigger pathological aggregation.

---

## Connection to Core Research

| Domain | Parallel Finding |
|:-------|:-----------------|
| **RA** | Citrullination boundaries predict autoimmunity |
| **HIV** | Multi-level hiding landscape |
| **Neurodegeneration** | Tau phosphorylation → aggregation threshold (hypothesis) |

---

## Future Directions

1. **Map tau phosphorylation sites** using 3-adic encoder
2. **Identify Goldilocks Zone** for aggregation triggers
3. **Compare to known pathological sites** (e.g., AT8, PHF-1 epitopes)
4. **Structural validation** with AlphaFold3
