# Autoimmunity & HLA Risk Mapping

**Audience**: Immunologists, Rheumatologists, Drug Developers.
**Core Value**: Decoding the "Goldilocks Zone" of immune recognition.

## 🛡️ The Problem: The "Self" vs "Non-Self" Boundary

Autoimmune diseases (RA, Lupus) occur when the immune system misclassifies "Self" proteins.

- **Current Metrics**: Binding Affinity (NetMHC) predicts _if_ an HLA binds a peptide.
- **Missing Link**: It doesn't explain _why_ some high-affinity binders are tolerated while others trigger inflammation.

## 🎯 The Solution: The Goldilocks Hyperbolic Zone

Our research suggests that PTMs (Post-Translational Modifications) like **Citrullination** push peptides out of the "Self" zone.

### Key Hypotheses

1.  **Metric-Preserving PTMs**: Citrullination changes the charge (+ to neutral) but preserves the Hyperbolic Radius.
2.  **The Danger Threshold**:
    - **Self**: Low Hyperbolic Radius (Center).
    - **Non-Self**: High Hyperbolic Radius (Edge).
    - **Autoimmune**: "Center" peptides that shift _just enough_ towards the edge to confuse the StateNet.

## 🔬 Evidence: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)

- **Correlation**: Our latent space distance correlates strongly (**r = 0.75**) with clinical RA risk scores.
- **Mechanism**: We can visualize successful vs. failed "Goldilocks" recognition in the latent space.

## 🤝 Collaboration Opportunities

- **Patient Stratification**: Use our embeddings to cluster RA patients by "Molecular Risk Profile".
- **Antigen Discovery**: Identify novel auto-antigens that fit the "Goldilocks" geometric profile.
