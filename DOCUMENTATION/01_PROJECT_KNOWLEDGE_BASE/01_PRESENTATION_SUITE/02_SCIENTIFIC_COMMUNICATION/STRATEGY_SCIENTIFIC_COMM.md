# Scientific Communication Strategy

**Objective**: Maximize impact, reproducibility, and funding potential across 4 key scientific domains.
**Status**: Active Execution

## 📂 Architecture

We have organized this suite into 3 Pillars:

### A. Research Domains (`A_Research_Domains`)

_Targeted material for specific experts._

1.  **Virology**: Forecasting & Escape Prediction.
2.  **Immunology**: Autoimmunity & HLA Risk.
3.  **Biophysics**: Field Theory & Compression.
4.  **Genomics**: Codon Optimization & Synthetic Bio.

### B. Foundations (`B_Foundations`)

_The "Source of Truth" for all domains._

- **00_Core_Manuscripts**: Whitepapers & Architecture Guides.
- **00_Fundamental_Theory**: Deep Mathematical Proofs.

### C. Strategic Assets (`C_Strategic_Assets`)

_Tools to accelerate impact._

- **Grants**: NIH/NSF Templates.
- **Visuals**: Diagrams & Renders.
- **Protocols**: Wet-lab Validation.
- **Conferences**: Posters & Talks.
- **Data**: Raw Supplements.

## 💡 5 Strategic Additions (The "Next Level")

### 1. 💰 Grant & Funding Engine (`05_Grant_Resources`)

- **Idea**: Don't just publish; get funded. Create modular "Insert Text Here" blocks for common grant applications (NIH R01, NSF, ERC).
- **What to think about**: How to frame "Hyperbolic Geometry" as "AI Safety" for one grant and "Precision Medicine" for another.

### 2. 📊 Visual Abstracts & Diagrams (`06_Visual_Abstracts`)

- **Idea**: A picture is worth 1000 citations. Create a dedicated folder for `mermaid` diagrams, PyMOL renders, and manifold visualizations.
- **What to think about**: How to visualize a 5-dimensional hyperbolic space in 2D (Poincaré Disk) for a biologist audience.

### 3. 🧪 Wet-Lab Validation Protocols (`07_Validation_Protocols`)

- **Idea**: Code is not enough. Provide exact PCR primers, cell lines, and assays to verify our predictions.
- **What to think about**: Partnering with a CRO (Contract Research Org) to run a $10k validation set.

### 4. 🎤 Conference Assets (`08_Conference_Materials`)

- **Idea**: Be ready for ISMB, NeurIPS, or Gordon Conferences. Templates for Posters (A0) and Lightning Talks (5 min).
- **What to think about**: The "Elevator Pitch" is different for a Math conference vs a Bio conference.

### 5. 📉 Supplementary Data Suites (`09_Supplementary_Data`)

- **Idea**: "Show me the data." CSVs of Top 100 mutant predictions, raw PyTorch weights, and benchmark logs.
- **What to think about**: Hosting large files (Zenodo/Figshare) and linking them here via DOI.

## 🧠 Strategic Questions

- **Peer Review**: Who are our likely reviewers? (Mathematicians will hate the Bio, Biologists will hate the Math). Strategy: "Trojan Horse" - lead with results (Bio), back with rigor (Math).
- **Open Science**: Should we release the "Goldilocks Encoder" as a public huggingface space? (High impact, low moat).
