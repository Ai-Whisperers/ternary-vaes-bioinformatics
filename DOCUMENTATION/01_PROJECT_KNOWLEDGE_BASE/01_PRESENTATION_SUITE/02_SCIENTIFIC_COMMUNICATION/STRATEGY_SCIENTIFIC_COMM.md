# Scientific Communication Strategy (Flattened)

**Objective**: Maximize discoverability and clarity for external stakeholders.

## 📂 The Flattened Structure

We have moved from a nested hierarchy to a "Prefix-Based" sorting system to reduce click depth.

### 1. `DOMAIN_*.md` (Audience Specific)

_Targeted material for specific experts._

- `DOMAIN_Virology_Viral_Escape.md`: For Virolgists.
- `DOMAIN_Immunology_HLA_Risk.md`: For Immunologists.
- `DOMAIN_Biophysics_Theory_of_Intelligence.md`: For Physicists.
- `DOMAIN_Genomics_Codon_Optimization.md`: For SynBio Engineers.

### 2. `THEORY_*.md` (Foundations)

_The "Source of Truth"._

- `THEORY_Technical_Whitepaper.md`: The main manuscript.
- `THEORY_Code_Architecture.md`: How to run the model.
- `THEORY_Math_Foundations/`: Detailed proofs.

### 3. `ASSET_*.md` (Strategic Resources)

_Tools for impact._

- `ASSET_Grant_Abstract.md`: Templates for funding.
- `ASSET_Design_Briefs.md`: Visual specs.
- `ASSET_Validation_Protocol.md`: Wet-lab plans.
