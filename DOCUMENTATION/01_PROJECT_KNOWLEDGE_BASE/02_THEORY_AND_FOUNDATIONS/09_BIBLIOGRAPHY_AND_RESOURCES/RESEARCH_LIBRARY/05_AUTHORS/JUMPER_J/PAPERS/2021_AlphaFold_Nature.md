## Abstract

Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14), demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods.

## Key Concepts

- Protein Folding Problem
- Deep Learning / Transformers
- MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment) Attention
- End-to-End Differentiable Structure Prediction
