## Abstract

This definitive book focuses on the application of information theory to molecular biology and the origin of life. Yockey argues that the genetic code is a digital communication system that follows Shannon's information theory, distinct from the chemical properties of the DNA molecule itself. He explores the "Central Dogma" as a communication channel and calculates the information content (entropy) of protein sequences to determine the probability of their spontaneous evolution.

## Key Concepts

- Central Dogma as Communication Channel
- Shannon Entropy of Sequences
- Digital Nature of Genetic Code
- Probability of Biogenesis
