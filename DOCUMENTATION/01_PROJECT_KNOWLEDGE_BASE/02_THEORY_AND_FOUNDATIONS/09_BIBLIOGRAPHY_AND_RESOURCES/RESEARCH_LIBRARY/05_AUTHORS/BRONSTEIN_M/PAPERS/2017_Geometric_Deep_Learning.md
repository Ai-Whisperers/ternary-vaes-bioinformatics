## Abstract

Geometric deep learning is an umbrella term for emerging techniques attempting to generalize (structured) deep neural models to non-Euclidean domains, such as graphs and manifolds. In this paper, we overview different examples of geometric deep learning problems and present available solutions, key difficulties, applications, and future research directions in this nascent field.

## Key Concepts

- Non-Euclidean Data
- Graph Neural Networks
- Manifold Learning
- 3D Shape Analysis
