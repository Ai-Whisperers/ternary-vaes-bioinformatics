## Abstract

We study the emergence of the genetic code as a transition in a noisy information channel. The mapping of codons to amino acids is viewed as an error-minimizing code. The emergence of the code is described as a phase transition where the mapping becomes non-random. The topology of the "error graph" (which codons are easily confused) determines the structure of the code. This topology relates to the graph coloring problem (hence "colorful origin"), suggesting that the dimensionality and connectivity of the error map dictate the maximal number of amino acids (20) and the specific arrangement of the code.
