## Abstract

Long COVID/PASC (Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19) is a condition affecting a significant proportion of COVID-19 survivors. Here we show that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein S1 induces structural changes in $\beta$ and $\gamma$ fibrin(ogen) that are resistant to trypsinization. We suggest that these anomalous (scrambled) fibrin(ogen) structures ('fibrin amyloid microclots') impede the transport of oxygen to tissues and are a central cause of the symptoms of PASC.

## Key Concepts

- Fibrin Amyloid Microclots
- SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein
- Coagulation Pathology
- Hypoxia in Long COVID
