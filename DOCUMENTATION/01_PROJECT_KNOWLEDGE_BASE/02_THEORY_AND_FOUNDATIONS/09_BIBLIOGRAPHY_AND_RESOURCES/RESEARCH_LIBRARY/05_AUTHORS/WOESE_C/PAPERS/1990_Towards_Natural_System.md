## Abstract

Molecular structures and sequences are generally more revealing of evolutionary relationships than are classical phenotypes (particularly so among microorganisms). Consequently, the basis for classification in the future is likely to be molecular. Here we propose a phylogenetic structure for the living world based upon ribosomal RNA sequences. The system we propose breaks the living world into three domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya.

## Key Concepts

- Three-Domain System
- Archaea Discovery
- 16S rRNA Phylogeny
- Molecular Taxonomy
