## Abstract

This review is devoted to the 30th anniversary of p-adic mathematical physics. It contains a brief history of the subject and a bibliography of about 3000 items. We consider the main directions of p-adic mathematical physics: p-adic string theory, p-adic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, p-adic dynamical systems and probability, p-adic stochastic processes, and p-adic modeling in biology and cognitive science.

## Key Concepts

- P-adic String Theory
- Ultrametric Spaces in Biology
- P-adic Cognitive Science
- Non-Archimedean Dynamics
