# Genetic Code Theory

## Strategic Context

This folder explores the _optimization objective_ of the standard genetic code. Is it optimized for error minimization (robustness) or resource conservation (efficiency)? This determines the "loss function" of our evolutionary VAE.

## Key Papers

- **Haig (1991)** & **Freeland (1998)**: The "Gold Standard" for error minimization theory.
- **Shenhav (2020)** vs **Xu (2021)**: The modern debate on resource conservation.
- **Woese (1965)**: The Stereochemical Hypothesis (physical affinity).

## Research Goal

Synthesize a "Hybrid Cost Function" that weighs both error minimization and metabolic cost, to train our VAE to generate realistic "alien" codes.
