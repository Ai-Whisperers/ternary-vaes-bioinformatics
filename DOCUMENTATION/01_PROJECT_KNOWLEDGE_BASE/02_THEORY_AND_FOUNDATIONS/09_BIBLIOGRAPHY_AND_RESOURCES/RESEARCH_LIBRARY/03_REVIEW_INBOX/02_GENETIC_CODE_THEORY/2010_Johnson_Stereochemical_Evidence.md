## Abstract (Summary)

Provided modern biological evidence for the Stereochemical Hypothesis. Showed that anticodons are selectively enriched near their respective amino acids in the ribosome structure, suggesting a direct, ancient physical affinity that guided the code's assignment.

## Key Concepts

- Structural Stereochemistry
- Ribosome Evolution
- Direct Amino Acid-Anticodon Affinity
