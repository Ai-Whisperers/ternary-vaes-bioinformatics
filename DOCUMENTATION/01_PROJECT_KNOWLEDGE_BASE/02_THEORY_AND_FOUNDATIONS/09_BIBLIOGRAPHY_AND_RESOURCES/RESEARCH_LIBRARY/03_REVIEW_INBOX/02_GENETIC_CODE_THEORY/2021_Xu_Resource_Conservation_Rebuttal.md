## Abstract (Summary)

A critical rebuttal to Shenhav & Zeevi (2020). Re-analyzed the data and argued that once proper null models (random codes) and mutation types are accounted for, there is statistically "little evidence" that the SGC is optimized for resource conservation, reinforcing the primacy of error minimization.

## Key Concepts

- Rebuttal / Critical Analysis
- Null Models in Evolution
- Error Minimization Dominance
