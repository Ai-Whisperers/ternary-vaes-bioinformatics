## Abstract (Summary)

One of the earliest computational studies (Monte Carlo simulation) to analyze the degeneracy of the genetic code. Demonstrated that the code minimizes the effects of mutations (misreading) better than random codes, laying the groundwork for the Error Minimization Hypothesis.

## Key Concepts

- Early Monte Carlo Simulation
- Degeneracy Pattern
- Mutation Buffering
