## Abstract

A cutting-edge (Dec 2024) study that overturns the "textbook" timeline of amino acid recruitment. Using phylogenetic reconstruction of ancient protein domains (pre-LUCA), Wehbi & Masel show that **Sulfur (Cys, Met)** and **Metal-binding (His)** amino acids were recruited _much earlier_ than previously thought (unlike the late recruitment predicted by the Miller-Urey paradigm).

## Key Findings

- **Early Recruitment:** Met, Cys, His were present in the "Early Code."
- **Why?** Early life (Iron-Sulfur World hypothesis) desperately needed catalysis (Metals/Sulfur) more than just structural blocks.
- **Methodology:** Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (ASR) on universal protein domains.

## Relevance to Project

**The "Iron-Sulfur" Input Data.**

- Defines the input dataset for our "Early Earth" VAE simulation.
- **Correction:** We must _not_ assume Cys is a late addition (as Wong 1975 might imply). Wehbi 2024 implies Cys/Met are foundational.
- **Implication:** The "P-adic distance" between Cys and the "Start" (Met) might be zero in temporal space.
