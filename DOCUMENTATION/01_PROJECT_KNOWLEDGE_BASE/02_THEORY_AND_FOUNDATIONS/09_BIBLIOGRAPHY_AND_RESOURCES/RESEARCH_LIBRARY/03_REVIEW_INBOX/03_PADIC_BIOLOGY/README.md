# P-adic & Ultrametric Biology

## Strategic Context

This folder provides the _mathematical engine_ for our project. It posits that biological information (DNA, Protein Folding) is naturally structured in ultrametric (p-adic) space, not Euclidean space.

## Key Papers

- **Dragovich (2009)**: The foundational text on p-adic genome modelling.
- **Khrennikov (2010)**: Application to disease spread and PAM matrices.
- **Becker (2024)**: Proof that p-adic clustering outperforms standard methods in scRNA-seq.

## Research Goal

Implement the p-adic metric ($d_p(x,y)$) as the core distance function in our model's latent space, replacing standard Euclidean distance.
