## Abstract (Summary)

Introduces p-adic Cellular Neural Networks (pCNNs) as a generalization of classical CNNs. Designed to operate on hierarchical data (p-adic numbers), they are capable of learning and processing patterns with inherent ultrametric structures, offering a novel approach for bio-inspired computing.

## Key Concepts

- p-Adic Neural Networks
- Ultrametric Deep Learning
- Hierarchical Data Processing
