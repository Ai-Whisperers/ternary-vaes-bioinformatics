## Abstract (Summary)

Introduced methods for hierarchical clustering using ultrametric embedding (Baire space). Relevant to biology ("taxonomy") and handling massive high-dimensional datasets like scRNA-seq. Posited that high-dimensional data naturally becomes ultrametric (sparse).

## Key Concepts

- Ultrametric Embedding
- Baire Space
- High-Dimensional Sparsity
