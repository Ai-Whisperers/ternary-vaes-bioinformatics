## Abstract (Summary)

Connected dendrograms (hierarchical clustering trees) to the Bruhat-Tits tree, a natural object in p-adic geometry. Provided a theoretical bridge between standard cluster analysis and rigorous p-adic geometry, referencing Dragovich's 5-adic DNA encoding as a prime example.

## Key Concepts

- Bruhat-Tits Tree
- Cluster Analysis Framework
- Geometric Clustering
