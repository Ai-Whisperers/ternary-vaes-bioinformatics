## Abstract (Summary)

Introduced a phylogenetic tool to investigate HIV-1 lineages experiencing latency. Demonstrated that cycling in and out of latency is a major factor in HIV-1 evolution. Activated latent viruses compete effectively with newer variants, maintaining "older" codon usage patterns in the population.

## Key Concepts

- Viral Latency Cycling
- Evolutionary Rate Reduction
- Reservoir Reseeding
