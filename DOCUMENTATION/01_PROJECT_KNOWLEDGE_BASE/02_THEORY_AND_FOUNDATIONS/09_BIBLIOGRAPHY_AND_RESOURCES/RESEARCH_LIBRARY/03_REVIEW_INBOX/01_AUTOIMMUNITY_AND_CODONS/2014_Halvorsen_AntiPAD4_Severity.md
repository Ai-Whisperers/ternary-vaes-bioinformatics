## Abstract (Summary)

Revealed a striking association between anti-PAD4 autoantibodies and the RA-susceptible _PADI4_ haplotype. Patients with these antibodies exhibited more severe joint destruction, suggesting a direct link between genetic susceptibility, specific autoimmunity, and clinical severity.

## Key Concepts

- Anti-PAD4 Antibodies
- Disease Severity
- Genotype-Phenotype Correlation
