## Abstract (Summary)

Demonstrated PADI4 expression in T cells, B cells, macrophages, and neutrophils within inflamed RA synovium. Showed co-localization of PADI4 and citrullinated proteins in fibrin deposits, linking PADI4 directly to the generation of citrullinated fibrin (a major autoantigen) and apoptosis.

## Key Concepts

- Synovial Citrullination
- Fibrin Autoantigens
- PADI4 Localization
