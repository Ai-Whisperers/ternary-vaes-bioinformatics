# Autoimmunity & Codon Usage Research

## Strategic Context

This folder contains research validating the "Goldilocks Zone" hypothesis: that viral latency forces viruses (HIV, EBV) to adopt specific codon usage patterns that mimic host self-antigens, triggering autoimmunity.

## Key Papers

- **Lanz et al. (2022)**: Definitive proof of molecular mimicry between EBV EBNA1 and GlialCAM in MS.
- **Wucherpfennig (1995)**: Foundational logic for T-cell cross-reactivity.
- **Pandit (2011)** & **Roy (2017)**: Evidence of HIV codon adaptation driving disease progression.

## Research Goal

Extract specific amino acid sequences and codon patterns from these papers to use as "positive controls" in our VAE's anomaly detection tests.
