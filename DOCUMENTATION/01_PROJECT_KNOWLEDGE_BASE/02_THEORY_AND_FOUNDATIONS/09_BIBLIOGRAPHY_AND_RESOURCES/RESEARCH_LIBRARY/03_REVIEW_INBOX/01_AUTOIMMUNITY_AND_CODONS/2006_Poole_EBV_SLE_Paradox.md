## Abstract (Summary)

Discusses the "paradox" of EBV's role in SLE. While EBV is ubiquitous, SLE patients show distinct immune dysregulation against it. The paper explores EBNA-1 molecular mimicry with Lupus autoantigens (Sm, Ro) and how the viral protein LMP1 mimics CD40, driving B-cell hyperactivity and autoimmunity.

## Key Concepts

- EBV-SLE Paradox
- CD40 Mimicry (LMP1)
- Epitope Spreading
