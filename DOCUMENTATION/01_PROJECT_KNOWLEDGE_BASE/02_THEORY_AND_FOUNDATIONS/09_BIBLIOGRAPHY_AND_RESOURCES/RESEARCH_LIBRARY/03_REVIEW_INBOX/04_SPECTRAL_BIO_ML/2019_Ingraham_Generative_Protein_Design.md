## Abstract (Summary)

Presented "Structured Transformer" and graph-based generative models for protein design (inverse folding). Demonstrated how graph neural networks can effectively model the dependencies between residues in the 3D structure to generate sequences.

## Key Concepts

- Inverse Folding
- Graph Neural Networks
- Generative Protein Design
