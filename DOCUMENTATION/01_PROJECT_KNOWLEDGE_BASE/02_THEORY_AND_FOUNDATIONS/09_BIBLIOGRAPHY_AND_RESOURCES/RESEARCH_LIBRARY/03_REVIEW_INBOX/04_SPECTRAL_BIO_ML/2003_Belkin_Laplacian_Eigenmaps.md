## Abstract (Summary)

The seminal computer science paper defining the Laplacian Eigenmaps algorithm. Showed that the eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian provide an optimal embedding that preserves local neighborhood information, linking graph theory to manifold learning.

## Key Concepts

- Laplacian Eigenmaps
- Spectral Embedding
- Graph Laplacian
