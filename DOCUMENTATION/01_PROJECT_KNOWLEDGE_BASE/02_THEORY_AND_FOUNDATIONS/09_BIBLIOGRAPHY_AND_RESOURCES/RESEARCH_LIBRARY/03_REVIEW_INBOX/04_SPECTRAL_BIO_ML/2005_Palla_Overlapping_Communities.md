## Abstract (Summary)

Seminal paper for community detection (clustering) in networks. Introduced the Clique Percolation Method (CPM) to find overlapping modules in protein interaction networks, revealing that proteins often belong to multiple functional groups (pleiotropy).

## Key Concepts

- Overlapping Communities
- Clique Percolation
- Network Modularity
