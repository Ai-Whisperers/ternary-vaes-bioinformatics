## Abstract (Summary)

A seminal paper in single-cell analysis (~2015). Introduced the use of Laplacian Eigenmaps (spectral embedding) to reduce the dimensionality of scRNA-seq data, followed by Principal Curves to infer "pseudotime" trajectories of cell differentiation.

## Key Concepts

- Laplacian Eigenmaps
- Pseudotime Ordering
- Single-Cell Trajectory Inference
