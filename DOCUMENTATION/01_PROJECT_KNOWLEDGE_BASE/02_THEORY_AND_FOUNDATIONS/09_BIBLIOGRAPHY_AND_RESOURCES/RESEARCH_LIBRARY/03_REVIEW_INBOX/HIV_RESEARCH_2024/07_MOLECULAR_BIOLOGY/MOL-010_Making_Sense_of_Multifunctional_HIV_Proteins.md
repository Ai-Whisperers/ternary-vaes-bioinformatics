## Abstract

HIV-1 regulatory proteins Tat and Rev are essential for viral gene expression and replication. Tat activates transcription elongation by recruiting P-TEFb to nascent transcripts, while Rev enables nuclear export of unspliced and partially spliced mRNAs encoding structural proteins. Recent research reveals intricate feedback mechanisms between these proteins, including Rev-mediated degradation of Tat, establishing distinct phases of viral transcription and protein synthesis.

## Key Concepts

- **Tat (Trans-Activator of Transcription)**: Essential transcription activator, binds TAR RNA
- **Rev (Regulator of Virion)**: Nuclear export factor, binds RRE
- **P-TEFb**: Cellular elongation factor (CDK9 + Cyclin T1) recruited by Tat
- **TAR**: Trans-Activation Response element (RNA stem-loop)
- **RRE**: Rev Response Element (RNA structure in env)

## Tat Protein Functions

### Primary Mechanism
```
RNA Pol II initiates transcription →
TAR RNA forms at 5' end →
Tat binds TAR →
Recruits P-TEFb (CDK9/CycT1) →
Hyperphosphorylates Pol II CTD →
Enhances processivity →
Full-length transcripts produced
```

### Quantitative Impact
| Without Tat | With Tat | Fold Change |
|:------------|:---------|:------------|
| Abortive transcripts | Full-length RNA | **100-1000x increase** |
| Short RNAs (~60 nt) | Complete genome | Productive infection |

## Tat Structural Features

### Functional Domains
| Domain | Residues | Function |
|:-------|:---------|:---------|
| Acidic/proline | 1-21 | Activation |
| Cysteine-rich | 22-37 | Metal binding, dimerization |
| Core | 38-48 | TAR binding |
| Basic (Arginine-rich) | 49-57 | Nuclear localization, TAR binding |
| Glutamine-rich | 58-72 | Auxiliary functions |

### TAR Binding
| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| RNA structure | Stem-loop with bulge |
| Tat binding site | Bulge region |
| Essential bases | U23, C24, U25 |
| CycT1 contact | Loop |

## Rev Protein Functions

### RNA Export Mechanism
```
Unspliced/partially spliced mRNA →
RRE forms in env region →
Rev binds RRE →
Oligomerizes on RNA →
Recruits CRM1 (exportin-1) →
Nuclear pore complex transport →
Cytoplasmic translation
```

### Rev-Dependent Transcripts
| Transcript | Encodes | Rev Requirement |
|:-----------|:--------|:----------------|
| Unspliced (9 kb) | Gag, Pol, full genome | **Essential** |
| Single-spliced (4 kb) | Env, Vif, Vpu, Vpr | **Essential** |
| Multiply-spliced (2 kb) | Tat, Rev, Nef | Not required |

## Tat-Rev Regulatory Feedback

### Rev-Mediated Tat Degradation
| Discovery | Significance |
|:----------|:-------------|
| Rev causes Tat degradation | Negative feedback |
| 20S proteasome pathway | Cytoplasmic Tat targeted |
| NQO1 involvement | NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase |
| Transcription decrease | Replication modulation |

> "HIV-1 Rev causes specific degradation of cytoplasmic Tat, which results in inhibition of HIV-1 replication."

### Other Tat Interactions
| Protein | Effect on Tat | Outcome |
|:--------|:--------------|:--------|
| Vpr | Increases transactivation | Enhanced expression |
| Nef | Increases transactivation | Enhanced expression |
| NC (Nucleocapsid) | Tat degradation | Suppression |
| Rev | Tat degradation | Negative feedback |

## Temporal Phases of HIV Expression

### Phase Model
| Phase | Dominant Proteins | Transcripts |
|:------|:------------------|:------------|
| **Early** | Tat, Rev, Nef | Multiply-spliced |
| **Transition** | Increasing Rev levels | Switch initiates |
| **Late** | Structural proteins | Unspliced, single-spliced |

### Regulatory Checkpoints
| Checkpoint | Control Mechanism |
|:-----------|:------------------|
| Tat levels | Rev-mediated degradation |
| Rev accumulation | Threshold for export switch |
| Structural protein production | Rev-dependent export |

> "The regulatory feedback mechanisms driven by HIV-1 Tat and Rev ensure that HIV-1 transcription proceeds through distinct phases."
