## Abstract

Tissue reservoirs represent the major obstacle to HIV cure. This review examines the anatomical and cellular distribution of HIV persistence, focusing on lymphoid tissues (lymph nodes, gut, spleen), the central nervous system, and other sanctuary sites. Understanding the unique characteristics of each tissue compartment is essential for developing targeted cure strategies, as the challenges and optimal approaches differ based on intrinsic reservoir properties.

## Key Concepts

- **Tissue Reservoirs**: HIV persists in anatomically distinct compartments
- **Lymphoid Tissue**: Contains ≥98% of total HIV reservoir
- **CNS Sanctuary**: Blood-brain barrier limits drug access
- **Reservoir Heterogeneity**: Cell types and latency states vary by tissue

## Major Tissue Reservoirs

### Distribution of HIV Reservoirs
| Tissue | Contribution | Primary Cell Types |
|:-------|:-------------|:-------------------|
| **Lymphoid tissues** | ≥98% | CD4+ T cells, macrophages |
| CNS | Low but persistent | Microglia, macrophages |
| Bone marrow | Variable | HSPCs, macrophages |
| Genitourinary | Variable | CD4+ T cells |
| Lungs | Variable | Alveolar macrophages |

> "Lymphoid tissues, including the gut, lymph nodes, and spleen, contain ≥98% of 'active' (vRNA+) and total (vDNA+) SIV reservoirs before and during ART."

## Lymph Node Reservoirs

### Key Findings (2024)
| Discovery | Significance |
|:----------|:-------------|
| Dendritic cells harbor HIV | New cellular reservoir identified |
| Replication-competent after 14+ years ART | Long-term persistence |
| TLR7/8 stimulation induces virus | Latency reversal potential |

> "Both LN DC subpopulations contain HIV intact provirus and inducible replication-competent HIV despite the expression of the antiviral restriction factor SAMHD1. LN DC subpopulations isolated from HIV-infected individuals treated for up to 14 years are transcriptionally silent but harbor replication-competent virus."

### Lymph Node Architecture
| Zone | HIV Persistence | Access |
|:-----|:----------------|:-------|
| B cell follicles | High | Low drug penetration |
| T cell zones | Moderate | Better penetration |
| Germinal centers | Variable | Immune sanctuary |

---

## Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)

### Characteristics
| Feature | Implication |
|:--------|:------------|
| High CD4+ T cell density | Major early target |
| Massive depletion in acute infection | Irreversible damage |
| Ongoing viral replication | Immune activation |
| Drug penetration variable | Incomplete suppression |

### GALT Reservoir Persistence
| Finding | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| HIV DNA in gut | Persists despite ART |
| Residual replication | Possible in some patients |
| Inflammation | Contributes to comorbidities |

---

## Central Nervous System (CNS) Reservoir

### Unique Challenges
| Challenge | Explanation |
|:----------|:------------|
| Blood-brain barrier | Poor drug penetration |
| Blood-CSF barrier | Additional protection |
| Long-lived microglia | 4+ year lifespan |
| Limited immune surveillance | Sanctuary site |

### CNS Cell Types
| Cell Type | Infection Status | Lifespan |
|:----------|:-----------------|:---------|
| Microglia | Major reservoir | Years |
| Astrocytes | Restricted infection | Long-lived |
| Perivascular macrophages | Productive | Months |

> "The CNS possesses unique intrinsic anatomical and physiological hallmarks. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) and choroid structures result in poor drug penetration, including for cART. Targeting latent reservoirs in the brain therefore remains a challenge."

## Therapeutic Strategies

### Tissue-Specific Approaches
| Target Tissue | Strategy | Status |
|:--------------|:---------|:-------|
| Lymphoid | LRA + immune effectors | Clinical trials |
| CNS | BBB-penetrant agents | Development |
| Gut | Localized delivery | Research |
| All | Systemic cure approaches | Multiple trials |

### Enhanced Trafficking Approaches
| Strategy | Mechanism |
|:---------|:----------|
| Lymph node targeting | Increase LRA delivery to sanctuary |
| Cell migration modulation | Drive infected cells out of tissue |
| Nanoparticle delivery | Targeted tissue penetration |

> "Strategies to enhance cellular trafficking towards these areas or block establishment of LT reservoirs may provide steps towards reservoir elimination."

## Spatial Technologies (2024)

### New Research Tools
| Technology | Application |
|:-----------|:------------|
| Single-cell RNA sequencing | Map infected cell phenotypes |
| Spatial transcriptomics | Localize reservoir in tissue |
| CRISPR screening | Identify latency factors |
| Tissue organoids | Model tissue reservoirs |
| mRNA technology | Novel therapeutic delivery |

> "New tools, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, CRISPR screenings, mRNA technology or tissue organoids are quickly developing and providing detailed information about the complex nature of the tissue reservoirs."

## Reservoir Clonality and Spread

### Clonal Expansion Findings
| Finding | Significance |
|:--------|:-------------|
| Clonal populations span tissues | Cellular migration |
| Blood-tissue exchange | Continuous redistribution |
| Inducible virus in clones | Replication-competent reservoir |

> "Near full-length HIV-1 sequencing in longitudinal samples from matched blood, lymph nodes, and gut indicates that clones of infected cells, including those carrying an inducible provirus, persist and spread across various anatomical compartments."

## Challenges for Cure

### Tissue-Specific Barriers
| Tissue | Primary Challenge |
|:-------|:------------------|
| Lymph nodes | Follicular sanctuary |
| Gut | Massive initial damage |
| CNS | Drug penetration |
| Bone marrow | Stem cell latency |

### Integration Points
| Challenge | Approach |
|:----------|:---------|
| Heterogeneous latency | Combination LRAs |
| Variable drug penetration | Tissue-optimized delivery |
| Immune exclusion zones | Engineered immune cells |

## Relevance to Project

Tissue reservoir research informs the Ternary VAE project:
- **Compartmentalized evolution**: Tissue-specific sequence variants
- **Cell type adaptation**: Codon usage patterns by reservoir
- **Drug resistance**: Sanctuary-derived resistance mutations
- **Sequence diversity**: Clonal expansion patterns
