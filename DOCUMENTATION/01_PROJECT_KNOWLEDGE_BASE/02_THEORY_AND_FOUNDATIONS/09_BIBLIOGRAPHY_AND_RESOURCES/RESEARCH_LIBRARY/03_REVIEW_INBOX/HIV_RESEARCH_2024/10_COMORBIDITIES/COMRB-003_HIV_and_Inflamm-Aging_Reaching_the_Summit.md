## Abstract

Despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) normalizing life expectancy, people living with HIV (PLWH) experience accelerated biological aging and increased age-related comorbidities. This 2024 review examines the convergence of HIV infection, chronic inflammation, and inflammasome dysregulation, proposing strategies to achieve healthy aging in PLWH.

## Key Concepts

- **Inflamm-aging**: Age-associated chronic low-grade inflammation
- **Immunosenescence**: Aging of the immune system
- **Inflammasome**: Multiprotein complex driving inflammatory responses
- **Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE)**: Years of life in good health

## The Aging HIV Population

### Demographic Shift
| Year | PLWH Over 50 (US) |
|:-----|:------------------|
| 2020 | >50% |
| 2030 (projected) | **70%** |

### ART Impact
> "ART-treated adults are immunologically two decades older than their HIV-negative counterparts."

---

## Mechanisms of Accelerated Aging

### 1. Chronic Immune Activation
| Marker | Status in PLWH |
|:-------|:---------------|
| IL-6 | Elevated |
| TNF-α | Elevated |
| IL-1β | Elevated |
| CRP | Elevated |
| D-dimer | Elevated |

### 2. Inflammasome Dysregulation
```
Chronic HIV → DAMPs/PAMPs release →
Inflammasome activation (NLRP3, AIM2) →
IL-1β, IL-18 release →
Systemic inflammation →
Accelerated aging
```

### 3. Gut-Immune Axis
| Factor | Effect |
|:-------|:-------|
| Microbial translocation | LPS in circulation |
| Dysbiosis | Altered microbiome |
| Barrier dysfunction | Persistent inflammation |

### 4. Mitochondrial Dysfunction
- ART-induced (especially older NRTIs)
- HIV protein toxicity (Tat, Vpr)
- Oxidative stress accumulation

## Age-Related Comorbidities in PLWH

### Earlier Onset Conditions
| Condition | Increased Risk |
|:----------|:---------------|
| Cardiovascular disease | 50-100% higher |
| Diabetes mellitus | 2-4x more common |
| Osteoporosis | Earlier onset |
| Chronic kidney disease | Higher prevalence |
| Non-AIDS cancers | Elevated risk |
| Neurocognitive impairment | 30-50% affected |
| Frailty | Premature onset |

### The "Perfect Storm"
> "The convergence of aging, HIV infection, and inflammasome dysregulation creates a perfect storm accelerating the aging process."

---

## Biomarkers of Accelerated Aging

### Epigenetic Clocks
| Measure | Finding |
|:--------|:--------|
| DNA methylation age | Accelerated by 5-10 years |
| GrimAge acceleration | Predicts mortality |
| PhenoAge | Elevated in PLWH |

### Telomere Length
> "HIV, elevated inflammatory markers, and methamphetamine use were each associated with shorter leukocyte telomere length, a marker of older biological age."

### Genetic Variants
- IL-6 SNPs associated with accelerated aging
- IL-10 variants may identify high-risk individuals

---

## Therapeutic Strategies

### Current Approaches
| Strategy | Target |
|:---------|:-------|
| Optimized ART | Minimize toxicity |
| Statins | Cardiovascular risk, anti-inflammatory |
| Aspirin | Inflammation, coagulation |
| Lifestyle | Exercise, diet, smoking cessation |

### Emerging Therapies
| Agent | Mechanism |
|:------|:----------|
| Anti-IL-6 (tocilizumab) | Block inflammatory cytokine |
| JAK inhibitors | Reduce immune activation |
| Senolytics | Clear senescent cells |
| NAD+ precursors | Mitochondrial function |

### The Ultimate Goal: HIV Cure
> "This accelerated immune aging underscores the need for an HIV cure to avert the unprecedented complications of accelerated immune senescence."

---

## Clinical Recommendations

### Screening
1. Start cardiovascular screening earlier (age 40 vs 50)
2. Regular bone density assessment
3. Cognitive screening in older PLWH
4. Comprehensive metabolic monitoring

### Prevention
1. Aggressive cardiovascular risk management
2. Exercise programs (resistance + aerobic)
3. Nutritional optimization
4. Smoking cessation priority

## Relevance to Project

Inflamm-aging research informs the Ternary VAE project:
- **Long-term evolution**: Sequence changes in aging cohorts
- **Selection pressures**: Beyond antiviral resistance
- **Biological context**: Validating computational models
- **Clinical translation**: Therapeutic target identification
