## Abstract

VH4524184 (VH-184) is a novel third-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) demonstrating activity against clinically resistant HIV-1 variants. Phase 1 data presented at AIDS 2024 show favorable pharmacokinetics with a 24-hour half-life supporting once-daily or long-acting dosing, good tolerability, and potent antiviral activity against INSTI-resistant isolates—representing a potential breakthrough for treatment-experienced patients.

## Key Concepts

- **Third-Generation INSTI**: New class with enhanced resistance coverage
- **Long-Acting Potential**: Extended half-life for monthly+ dosing
- **Resistance Profile**: Activity against first/second-gen INSTI mutations
- **VH-184**: Abbreviation for VH4524184

## Comparison with Existing INSTIs

### Generations of INSTIs
| Generation | Examples | Characteristics |
|:-----------|:---------|:----------------|
| First | Raltegravir, Elvitegravir | Lower barrier, BID dosing |
| Second | Dolutegravir, Bictegravir, Cabotegravir | High barrier, QD or LA |
| **Third** | **VH4524184** | Resistance coverage, LA potential |

### Key Differentiators
| Feature | Second-Gen | VH-184 |
|:--------|:-----------|:-------|
| INSTI-resistant virus activity | Limited | **Broad** |
| Half-life | 12-41 hours | **24 hours** |
| Long-acting potential | CAB only | **Yes** |
| Drug interactions | Minimal | **Minimal** |

## Target Population

### Primary Indications
| Population | Rationale |
|:-----------|:----------|
| INSTI-experienced with resistance | Primary target |
| Heavily treatment-experienced | Salvage therapy |
| Long-acting preference | Convenience |
| First-line ART | Future expansion |

### Unmet Need Addressed
| Problem | VH-184 Solution |
|:--------|:----------------|
| Limited options after INSTI failure | Active against resistant virus |
| Oral-only options for resistance | LA formulation in development |
| Cross-resistance concerns | Distinct resistance profile |
