## Abstract

Together TakeMeHome (TTMH) is the largest HIV self-testing program in the United States, funded by CDC to distribute HIV self-tests directly to consumers by mail. In its first year (March 2023-2024), the program exceeded expectations, distributing 443,813 tests to 219,360 persons—more than double the anticipated annual volume—while reaching priority populations often missed by traditional testing.

## Key Concepts

- **HIV Self-Testing (HIVST)**: At-home rapid HIV tests ordered online
- **Direct-to-Consumer**: Bypassing clinical settings for test access
- **Priority Populations**: MSM, Black women, gender-diverse individuals
- **Digital Outreach**: Dating apps as primary recruitment platform

## Key Success Factors

### Why the Program Exceeded Expectations
1. **Removed barriers**: No appointments, travel, or clinic visits
2. **Reduced stigma**: Private, anonymous ordering
3. **Digital outreach**: Met people where they are (apps)
4. **Free access**: No cost barrier to testing
5. **Convenience**: Delivered directly to home

---

## Public Health Impact

### Significance
> "Removing barriers, stigma prompted unexpected surge for HIV self-testing program."

### Implications
1. Self-testing reaches previously untested populations
2. Digital platforms effective for HIV prevention outreach
3. Scalable model for nationwide implementation
4. Gateway to PrEP and other prevention services

## Relevance to Project

While focused on diagnostics rather than virology, TakeMeHome informs:
- **Population surveillance**: Who gets tested, where, when
- **Epidemic dynamics**: Reaching undiagnosed populations
- **Prevention context**: Integration with PrEP access
- **Public health translation**: Moving from research to implementation
