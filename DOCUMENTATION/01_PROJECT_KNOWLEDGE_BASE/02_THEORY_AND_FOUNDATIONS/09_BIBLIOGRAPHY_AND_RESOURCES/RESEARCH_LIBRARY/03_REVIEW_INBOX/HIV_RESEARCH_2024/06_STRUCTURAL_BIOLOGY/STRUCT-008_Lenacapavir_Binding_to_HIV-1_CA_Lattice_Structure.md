# Lenacapavir Binding to HIV-1 Capsid Lattice: Structural Basis

**ID:** STRUCT-008
**Year:** 2023-2024
**Journal:** PNAS; eLife; JACS
**PDB:** [8G6O](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8G6O)
**Resolution:** 3.1 Å

## Abstract

Structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography have revealed the molecular basis of lenacapavir (GS-6207) binding to the HIV-1 capsid lattice. Lenacapavir binds to the FG-binding pocket between adjacent capsid protein (CA) monomers in hexamers, inducing lethal hyperstabilization that prevents capsid uncoating and causes virion failure.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Capsid Lattice**: Hexagonal/pentagonal arrangement of CA proteins
- **FG-Binding Pocket**: Phenylalanine-Glycine binding site between NTD and CTD
- **Hyperstabilization**: Drug-induced excessive capsid rigidity
- **Hexamer-Specific**: Lenacapavir binds hexamers but not pentamers

---

## Binding Mechanism

### FG-Binding Pocket Location
| Domain | Position |
|:-------|:---------|
| NTD | N-terminal domain of one CA monomer |
| CTD | C-terminal domain of adjacent CA monomer |
| Interface | Between two adjacent monomers in hexamer |

### Binding Specificity
> "GS-6207 binds exclusively to hexamers, a behavior that arises from key structural differences between pentamers and hexamers."

### Structural Changes Upon Binding
1. **Conformational change** in capsid protein (CA) region
2. **Altered lattice architecture** of Gag assembly
3. **Increased rigidity** of capsid shell
4. **Blocked host interactions** required for nuclear import

## Cryo-EM Structures

### PDB Entry 8G6O
| Property | Details |
|:---------|:--------|
| Title | HIV-1 capsid lattice bound to IP6 and Lenacapavir |
| Method | Cryo-EM with tomography + SPA |
| Resolution | 3.1 Å |
| Features | Hexamers and pentamers visualized |

### 2024 Immature Lattice Studies
| Finding | Significance |
|:--------|:-------------|
| LEN binds immature Gag | First structural evidence |
| Distinct binding mode | Different from mature capsid |
| Concurrent with BVM | Can bind simultaneously with bevirimat |

## Mechanism of Action: Hyperstabilization

### Normal Capsid Dynamics
```
Virus entry → Capsid transport → Uncoating → RT/integration
                  ↓
         Controlled disassembly
```

### With Lenacapavir
```
Virus entry → LEN binding → Hyperstabilization →
    ↓
Capsid failure (too rigid)
    ↓
Blocked uncoating → No integration → No infection
```

### Quantitative Effects
> "Lenacapavir's potent antiviral activity is predominantly due to lethal hyperstabilisation of the capsid lattice and resultant loss of compartmentalisation."

---

## Multiple Stages Affected

| Stage | LEN Effect |
|:------|:-----------|
| Nuclear import | Blocked CA-host interactions |
| Uncoating | Prevented by hyperstabilization |
| Integration | Impaired due to failed uncoating |
| Assembly (late) | Disrupted immature Gag lattice |

---

## Resistance Mutations

### Key Resistance Sites
| Mutation | Location | Effect |
|:---------|:---------|:-------|
| Q67H | Hexamer interface | Reduced LEN binding |
| K70R | FG-binding pocket | Altered drug interaction |
| N74D | Adjacent to pocket | Structural compensation |
| T107N | NTD-CTD interface | Reduced sensitivity |

### Structural Basis of Resistance
> Resistance mutations cluster at the drug-binding interface, either directly reducing lenacapavir affinity or compensating for fitness costs.

---

## Significance

### Drug Development Implications
1. **First capsid inhibitor structure** at high resolution
2. **Explains selectivity** for hexamers vs pentamers
3. **Predicts resistance** through structural modeling
4. **Guides optimization** of next-generation inhibitors

### Unique Mechanism
Unlike other antivirals:
- Targets assembled structure (not enzyme)
- Acts at multiple stages
- Induces structural failure

---

## Relevance to Project

Lenacapavir structural studies inform the Ternary VAE project:
- **Capsid sequence constraints**: Residues critical for lattice assembly
- **Resistance prediction**: Structural basis for escape mutations
- **Codon usage**: Conservation at drug-binding residues
- **Fitness landscape**: Trade-offs between resistance and assembly
