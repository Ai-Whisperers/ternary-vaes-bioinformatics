## Abstract (Summary)

The classic manifesto of Network Biology. Established the scale-free nature of biological networks (including PPIs) and the importance of hubs and modularity. While not "spectral" only, it defined the topological graph theory framework that spectral methods later analyzed.

## Key Concepts

- Scale-Free Networks
- Hubs and Modules
- Topological Analysis
