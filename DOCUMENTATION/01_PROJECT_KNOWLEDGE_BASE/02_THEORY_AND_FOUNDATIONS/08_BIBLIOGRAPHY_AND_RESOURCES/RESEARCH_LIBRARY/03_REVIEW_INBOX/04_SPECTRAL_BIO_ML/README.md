# Spectral & Geometric Bio-ML

## Strategic Context

This folder contains the _computational architecture_ required to process biological data. We need Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) to handle the complex, non-Euclidean shapes of proteins and interaction networks.

## Key Papers

- **Jing (2020)**: Geometric Vector Perceptrons (GVPs) for protein structure.
- **Coifman (2006)**: Diffusion Maps (Manifold Learning).
- **Gainza (2020)**: MaSIF (Surface Fingerprints).

## Research Goal

Adapt these architectures to work with our P-adic metric. Specifically, we aim to design a "P-adic GCN" (Graph Convolutional Network) that aggregates information based on ultrametric proximity.
