## Abstract (Summary)

Extended Diffusion Maps to define "Diffusion Pseudotime" (DPT). This metric measures the distance between cells along the biological manifold, providing a robust way to reconstruct branching lineage trees from single-cell data.

## Key Concepts

- Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT)
- Branching Lineages
- Manifold Distance
