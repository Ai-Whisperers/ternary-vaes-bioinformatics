# Islatravir: Evaluation of Clinical Development for HIV and HBV

**ID:** TRT-012
**Year:** 2024

## Abstract

Islatravir (ISL, MK-8591) is a first-in-class nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTI) with an exceptionally long intracellular half-life (192 hours). However, dose-dependent decreases in CD4+ T cells led to clinical holds and program restructuring. This review evaluates islatravir's development history, dose optimization, and future potential.

## Key Concepts

- **NRTTI**: Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Translocation Inhibitor (new class)
- **Islatravir (ISL)**: Deoxyadenosine analog with unique mechanism
- **CD4 Decline**: Dose-dependent lymphocyte reduction
- **Dose Optimization**: Reduced doses (0.25mg daily, 2mg weekly) under evaluation

## Mechanism of Action

| Feature | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| Drug class | First-in-class NRTTI |
| Chemical type | Deoxyadenosine analog |
| Intracellular half-life | **192 hours** |
| Active form | Islatravir-triphosphate |

---

## CD4 Lymphocyte Safety Concern

### Dose-Dependent Effect
| Dose Range | CD4 Effect |
|:-----------|:-----------|
| Higher doses (>2mg) | Significant decline |
| **0.25mg daily** | **Minimal effect** |
| **2mg weekly** | **Acceptable** |

> "Falls in lymphocytes and CD4 cells emerged at nearly all doses and were larger with larger doses."

## Active Development Programs (2024-2025)

### Weekly Islatravir + Lenacapavir
| Trial | Design |
|:------|:-------|
| Phase 2b | Switch study, 48 weeks |
| Dose | ISL 2mg + LEN 300mg weekly |
| CD4 effect | **Stable** |

### Ongoing Phase 3 Trials
| Trial | Comparison |
|:------|:-----------|
| ISLEND-1 | ISL/LEN vs B/F/TAF |
| ISLEND-2 | ISL/LEN vs existing regimens |

---

## Discontinued Programs

| Program | Outcome |
|:--------|:--------|
| Monthly oral PrEP | Discontinued |
| Doravirine/islatravir 0.75mg | Discontinued |

---

## Future: MK-8527

| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| Mechanism | Same as islatravir |
| Advantage | May lack CD4 toxicity |
| Status | Early development |

## Relevance to Project

Islatravir research informs the Ternary VAE project:
- **RT translocation mechanism**: Novel inhibition target
- **Resistance mutations**: NRTTI-specific escape pathways
- **Sequence conservation**: RT active site constraints
