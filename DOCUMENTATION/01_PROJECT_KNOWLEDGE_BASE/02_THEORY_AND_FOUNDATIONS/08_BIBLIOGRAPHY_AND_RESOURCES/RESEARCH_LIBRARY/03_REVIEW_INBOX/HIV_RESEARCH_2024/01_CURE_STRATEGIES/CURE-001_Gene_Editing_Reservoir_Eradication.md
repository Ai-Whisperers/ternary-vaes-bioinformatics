# Breaking Barriers to an HIV-1 Cure: Gene Editing, Immune Modulation, and Reservoir Eradication

**ID:** CURE-001
**Year:** 2025
**Journal:** Life (MDPI)
**DOI:** [10.3390/life15020276](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/15/2/276)

## Abstract

This comprehensive 2025 review synthesizes advances in HIV cure research across three major approaches: gene-editing technologies (CRISPR-Cas9), immune modulation strategies, and reservoir eradication methods. With 39.9 million people living with HIV globally (UNAIDS 2024), the need for curative approaches beyond lifelong ART remains urgent.

## Key Concepts

- **Gene Editing**: CRISPR-Cas9 excision of integrated HIV provirus
- **Immune Modulation**: Enhancing host responses to clear infected cells
- **Reservoir Eradication**: Eliminating latently infected cell populations
- **Combination Approaches**: Integrating multiple therapeutic modalities

## Global HIV Burden (2024)

| Metric | Value |
|:-------|:------|
| People living with HIV | 39.9 million |
| New infections (2023) | 1.3 million |
| AIDS-related deaths | 630,000 |

---

## Gene Editing: EBT-101 Clinical Trial (2024)

### Trial Design
| Parameter | Details |
|:----------|:--------|
| Delivery | AAV9 vector |
| Targets | 3 sites on HIV proviral DNA |
| Participants | 6 patients |

### Results
| Outcome | Observation |
|:--------|:------------|
| Safety | Proven safe in humans |
| Viral rebound | Occurred in all 4 with ATI |
| Notable case | 16-week delayed rebound |

> "HIV RNA levels rebounded in all four participants, but one patient had a delayed rebound of almost 16 weeks along with a significant drop in the HIV reservoir."

## Laboratory Breakthroughs (2024-2025)

### Amsterdam UMC Study
| Finding | Significance |
|:--------|:-------------|
| Complete HIV elimination | In cell culture |
| Technology | Latest CRISPR-Cas |

### CCR5 Editing (2025)
| Achievement | Details |
|:------------|:--------|
| Editing efficiency | >90% of blood stem cells |
| Off-target effects | Minimal |

## Major Challenges

### Delivery to Reservoirs
| Challenge | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| Accessibility | No system reaches all infected cells |
| Latent cells | Quiescent cells difficult to target |
| Tissue penetration | Brain, lymph nodes, gut |

> "Safe and effective delivery to latent reservoirs remains a huge challenge."

### Viral Diversity
| Challenge | Solution Needed |
|:----------|:----------------|
| Subtype variation | gRNAs conserved across subtypes |
| Escape mutations | Target multiple sites |

---

## Reservoir Eradication Strategies

| Approach | Method |
|:---------|:-------|
| **Shock and Kill** | Reactivate + immune clearance |
| **Block and Lock** | Permanent silencing |
| **Gene Editing** | Physical excision |
| **Stem Cell Transplant** | Replace immune system |

---

## Future Directions

| Priority | Approach |
|:---------|:---------|
| Improved delivery | LNPs, alternative vectors |
| Higher CRISPR doses | EBT-101 dose escalation |
| Global gRNA design | Subtype-inclusive targets |

---

## Relevance to Project

Gene editing research informs the Ternary VAE project:
- **Conserved sequences**: Identifying universal CRISPR targets
- **Subtype variation**: Mapping gRNA-compatible regions
- **Escape mutations**: Predicting resistance to gene therapy
- **LTR sequences**: Targets for excision and silencing
