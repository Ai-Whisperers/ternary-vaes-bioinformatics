## Abstract (Summary)

Investigated the influence of Envelope (env) protein codon usage on disease progression. Long-term non-progressors (LTNP) show stronger purifying selection and distinct amino acid usage compared to rapid progressors. This highlights how host-associated selective constraints (immune pressure) shape viral codon adaptation and disease outcomes.

## Key Concepts

- Disease Progression (LTNP vs RP)
- Purifying Selection
- Amino Acid Usage Profile
