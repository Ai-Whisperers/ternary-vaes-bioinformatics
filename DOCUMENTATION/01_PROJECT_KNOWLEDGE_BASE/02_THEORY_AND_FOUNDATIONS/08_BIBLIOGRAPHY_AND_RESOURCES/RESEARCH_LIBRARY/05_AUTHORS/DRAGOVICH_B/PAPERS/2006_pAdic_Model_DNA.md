## Abstract

We propose a p-adic model of the genetic code. The genetic code is a mapping from the set of 64 codons to the set of 20 amino acids and a stop signal. We represent codons as elements of a p-adic information space. This space naturally captures the hierarchical structure of the code (doublets, triplets). We specifically construct a 5-adic model combined with a 2-adic distance metric, which reveals that codons coding for the same amino acid are clustered together in this 5-adic space, demonstrating the mathematical "smoothness" or optimality of the natural genetic code.

## Key Concepts

- P-adic Information Space
- 5-adic / 2-adic Metrics
- Clustering of Synonymous Codons
- Ultrametric Biology
