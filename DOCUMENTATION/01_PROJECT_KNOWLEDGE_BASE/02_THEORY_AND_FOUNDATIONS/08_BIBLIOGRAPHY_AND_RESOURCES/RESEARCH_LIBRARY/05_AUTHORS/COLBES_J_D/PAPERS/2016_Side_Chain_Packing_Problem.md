## Abstract

The prediction of protein side-chain conformations (PSCPP) is a central problem in protein structure prediction. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art methods and benchmark them. We analyze whether the current limit in accuracy is due to the search algorithms (heuristics) or the energy functions used. Our findings suggest that classical heuristics like SCWRL4 and FASPR may be hitting a performance ceiling, and that future improvements might require novel optimization approaches or scoring functions, such as those leveraging deep learning or geometric insights.

## Key Concepts

- Side-Chain Packing (PSCPP)
- Combinatorial Optimization
- Performance Ceiling
- Energy Scoring Functions
