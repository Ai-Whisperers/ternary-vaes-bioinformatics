# Project Roadmaps & Plans

This directory serves as the **Strategic Command Center** for the Ternary VAE Bioinformatics project.

## 📂 Structure

### 01_STRATEGIC_VISIONS/

Contains high-level, long-term strategic documents that define the "Why" and "Where" of the project.

- **`MASTER_STRATEGIC_VISION_2025.md`**: The definitive document consolidating the Hyperbolic, Exascale, and Radius strategies. **Start here.**

### 02_EXECUTION_PLANS/

Contains concrete, tactical roadmaps that define the "What" and "When".

- **`THEORY_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`**: Tasks for implementing the math/bio foundations.
- **`PAPER_VALIDATION_PLAN.md`**: Plan for validating bibliography findings.
- **`RESEARCH_LIBRARY_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`**: Plan for the "Review Inbox".
- **`RESEARCH_PROPOSALS_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`**: Milestones for specific proposals.
- **`MILESTONES.md`**: High-level project milestones (Quarterly).
- **`IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`**: Technical debt and code health improvements.
- **`VALIDATION_AND_BENCHMARKING_PLAN.md`**: Testing strategies.

### 03_ARCHIVED_PLANS/

Contains deprecated or superseded planning documents. These are kept for historical context but are no longer active sources of truth.

- `2025_HYPERBOLIC_MANIFOLD_STRATEGY.md` (Merged into Master Vision)
- `2025_Q1_EXASCALE_SEMANTICS.md` (Merged into Master Vision)
- ...and others.
