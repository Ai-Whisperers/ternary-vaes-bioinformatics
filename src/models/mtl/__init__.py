"""Multi-task learning module.

Provides architectures for jointly predicting multiple related tasks:
- Drug resistance across multiple drugs
- Cross-resistance patterns
- Escape mutations
- Fitness costs

Key components:
- MultiTaskResistancePredictor: Main MTL model for drug resistance
- TaskHead: Individual task-specific heads
- CrossTaskAttention: Attention between task representations
- GradNorm: Automatic task weighting
