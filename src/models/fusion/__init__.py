"""Cross-modal fusion module.

Provides mechanisms for combining representations from multiple modalities:
- Sequence embeddings (from VAE, PLM)
- Structure embeddings (from SE(3) encoder)
- Property embeddings

Key components:
- CrossModalFusion: Attention-based fusion
- GatedFusion: Gated combination
- MultimodalEncoder: End-to-end multimodal encoding
